<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="what"></a> What are OpenSSO Extensions?</b></b></p>

<p>OpenSSO Extensions is an incubator for modules that build on the access control, single sign-on and federation technology in OpenSSO, but are not part of the core project. As OpenSSO Extensions is not part of the core OpenSSO <code>product</code> tree, the rules are more relaxed for code review and check in</a>.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="where"></a> Where are OpenSSO Extensions stored?</b></b></p>

<p>OpenSSO Extensions are checked into the <code>extensions</code> subtree</a>.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="lightbulb"></a> What is Lightbulb and how does it compare to OpenSSO Extensions?</b></b></p>

<p>Lightbulb was intended to be a set of sub-projects that focused on implementing federation technologies for the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) stack; the name was intended as a pun. The initial sub-project was a SAML version 2.0 service provider developed using PHP. As the number of potential contributions has grown to encompass modules that build on OpenSSO without targeting LAMP, we decided to change the name.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="contribute"></a> Can I contribute to OpenSSO Extensions?</b></b></p>


<p>Yes. Contributions are welcome! The <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/governance/sca.html">Sun Contributor Agreement</a> applies to OpenSSO Extensions, just as it does to the OpenSSO core, but the relaxed governance is intended to encourage widespread participation.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="supported"></a> Can the code in OpenSSO Extensions become part of the OpenSSO product?</b></b></p>


<p>Another yes. The mechanism for promotion (besides a consensual decision by the OpenSSO team) would be to simply move a subtree from <code>opensso/extensions</code> to <code>opensso/product</code>.
