<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="what_is"></a> What is OpenSSO?</b></b></p>


<p>The Open Web Single Sign-On Project, referred to as OpenSSO, is an open development effort based on the source code for <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/access_mgr/index.xml">Sun Java<sup>TM</sup> System Access Manager</a> and <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/federation_mgr/index.xml">Sun Java System Federation Manager</a>, two identity and federation products offered by Sun Microsystems, Inc. The goal of OpenSSO is to provide an extensible foundation for an identity services infrastructure in the public domain, facilitating single sign-on (SSO) for web applications hosted on web and application servers.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="why"></a> Why would Sun open source this proprietary code?</b></b></p>

<p>The official Sun Microsystems answer to this question can be found on the <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/products/identity/opensso/faq.xml">Sun web site</a>. In short, Sun's goal is to improve developer access to SSO technology so that it can become a ubiquitous part of web security infrastructure. OpenSSO gives developers the freedom to secure their internal web infrastructure using SSO technology without adding software licensing costs to their budgets.</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="benefits"></a> What are the benefits of open-sourcing software?</b></b></p>

<p>Open-sourcing software:
<P></P>
<ul>
<li>Allows developers to cooperate freely across time and distance with a minimum of legal restrictions.</li>
<li>Increases code quality and security.</li>
<li>Reduces deployment costs.</li>
<li>Increases the capacity for customization.</li>
<li>Encourages reusable software.</li>
<li>Enables a community where skill and merit matter.</li>
</ul></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="openssobenefits"></a> What are the benefits of OpenSSO?</b></b></p>

<p>The availability of free, open source code that provides identity-based authentication and single sign-on capabilities will lead to broad adoption of the technology in the Java community. The modules available in OpenSSO comprise an identity service that allows for user authentication and single sign-on within a domain. Developers can freely incorporate this identity service into the web or J2EE-based applications or services they provide.
</p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="objectives"></a> What are the objectives of the OpenSSO project?</b></b></p>

<p>The objectives of the OpenSSO project are:
<P></P>
<ul>
<li>To provide open access to an identity infrastructure source code.</li>
<li>To enable innovation to build the next generation of open network identity services.</li>
<li>To establish open XML-based file formats and language-independent component application programming interfaces (APIs).</li>
</ul></p></td></tr>


<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="comprises"></a> What comprises OpenSSO?</b></b></p>
