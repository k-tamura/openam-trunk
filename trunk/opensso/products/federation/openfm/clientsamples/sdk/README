This README file provides brief instructions on running OpenSSO
client sdk samples  that would run in a stand alone JVM, outside of any
container.

1. Unzip the opensso-client.zip. You would find a directory samples/sdk. 
   This directory has all that is required to try out OpenSSO 
   client sdk samples.

   The directory is laid out as below:
     + sdk
     |- source    (contains source files that require compilation)
     |- scripts   (contains scripts to compile and run samples)
     |- resources (contains resources required to run the samples)
     |- lib       (contains jar files required to use the OpenSSO clientsdk)
     |- classes   (contains the compiled classes from the source files)

2. To compile the samples:
   -- Make scripts/compile-samples.sh executable using chmod command for 
      UNIX system.
   -- Execute scripts/compile-samples.sh

3. To run the sample:
   -- Make all sh scripts under "scripts" directory executable, 
      e.g. chmod 755 scripts/*.sh
   -- Run scripts/setup.sh (or setup.bat)  
      This will setup AMConfig.properties to point to the OpenSSO server.
      This only need to be run this once for the all client SDK samples.
   -- Run individual client SDK samples by executing the shell or bat scripts 
      under "scripts" directory, e.g. scripts/run-xacml-client-sample.sh
      Sample runtime may require additional property files to be correctly set 
      up under resoruces directory. This would be specifically mentioned in the
      comments included in corresponding scripts.
