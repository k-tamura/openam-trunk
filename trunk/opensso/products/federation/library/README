    %% 1. Build requirements
    %% 2. Library dependencies
    %% 3. Building the workspace


%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenFederation Library workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. 
The build scripts in this workspace use features not present in releases 
of Ant prior to 1.6.  Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have 
Ant version 1.6.5 or above installed and available in your system path.
Set the ANT_HOME environment variable to the Ant root directory, and add 
${ANT_HOME}/bin to your PATH environment variable.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 5.0 with the source
and target levels set to "1.4". In order to allow this, you must ensure that
JDK 5.0 is present in your system path and the JAVA_HOME environment variable
is setup correctly pointing to its location.

%% 2. Library dependencies

%% 2.1 Follow section 2 of the README under "opensso/products" directory to 
       resolve external library dependencies, and copy corresponding jars to  
       the "opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace. 
%% 2.2 Open Federation Library depends on openSSO shared library, you could
       - check out source code under "opensso/products/shared" branch.
       OR
       - download opensso-sharedlib.jar from web site
         https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/use/index.html
	 and copy it to the "opensso/products/federation/library/extlib" 
         directory of your workspace.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
 
     - build      : compiles the sources
     - unittest   : generates unit test zip file
     - publicdoc  : creates javadocs for publicly supported API
     - doc        : creates all implementation javadocs
     - clean      : deletes the generated files
     - usage      : displays this usage message
