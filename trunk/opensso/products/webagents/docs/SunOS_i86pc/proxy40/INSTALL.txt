Thank you for using OpenAM Policy Agent. INSTALL NOTE: Installer modifies
obj.conf file in the config directory you specified. UNINSTALL NOTE:
Uninstall removes agent settings from obj.conf file in the config directory
you specified. If there are multiple obj.conf files configured manually in
the same config directory, then please remove them manually. For more
information, please refer agent documentation.


%% 2. Agent Uninstallation

Use agentadmin --uninstall option to uninstall the agent. Uninstallation does
the following:

    - Unconfigures obj.conf files.
    - Removes agent instance's config directory.

To completely remove the agent installation files, go back to web_agents and
simply remove the directory.


Here is the sample:


[/opt/web_agents/proxy40_agent/bin]> ./agentadmin --uninstall
