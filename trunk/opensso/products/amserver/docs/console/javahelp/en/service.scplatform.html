<a name="service.scplatform"></a><h4>Platform</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-205"></a>The Platform service is where additional servers can be added to the OpenSSO
configuration as well as other options applied at the top level of the
OpenSSO application. The Platform service attributes are global attributes. The attributes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#fxcgy">Platform Locale</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcpo">Cookie Domains</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxcmi">Available Locales</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fxctg">Client Character Sets</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="fxcgy"></a><h5>Platform Locale</h5>
<p>The platform locale value is the default language subtype that OpenSSO was installed
with. The authentication, logging and administration services are administered in the language of
this value. The default is en_US. See <a href="supportedlang.html">Supported Language Locales</a>for a listing of supported language
subtypes.</p>

<a name="fxcpo"></a><h5>Cookie Domains</h5>
<p>The list of domains that will be returned in the cookie header when
setting a cookie to the user's browser during authentication. If empty, no cookie
domain will be set. In other words, the OpenSSO session cookie will only
be forwarded to the OpenSSO itself and to no other servers in the
domain.</p><p>If SSO is required with other servers in the domain, this attribute must
be set with the cookie domain. If you had two interfaces in
different domains on one OpenSSO then you would need to set both cookie
domains in this attribute. If a load balancer is used, the cookie domain
must be that of the load balancer's domain, not the servers behind the load
balancer. The default value for this field is the domain of the installed
OpenSSO.</p>

<a name="fxcmi"></a><h5>Available Locales</h5>
<p>This attribute stores all available locales configured for the platform. Consider an application
that lets the user choose the user's locale. This application would get this
attribute from the platform profile and present the list of locales to the
user. The user would choose a locale and the application would set this
in the user entry  <i>preferredLocale</i>.</p>

<a name="fxctg"></a><h5>Client Character Sets</h5>
<p>This attribute specifies the character set for different clients at the platform level.
It contains a list of client types and the corresponding character sets. See<a href="service.scplatformclientcharsetsadd.html">To Create a New Character Set</a>
for more information.</p>
