<a name="indexterm-81"></a><a name="indexterm-82"></a><p>This attribute defines any trusted partner (remote to the server on which OpenSSO
is installed) that will be communicating with OpenSSO.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>The trusted partner site must have a prearranged trust relationship with one or
more of the sites configured in the Site Identifiers attribute.</p>
<hr>
<p>The first step in configuring a trusted partner is to determine the partner's
role in the trust relationship. A trusted partner can be a source site
(one that generates a single sign-on assertion) or a destination site (one that
consumes a single sign-on assertion). For example, if the partner is the source
site, this attribute is configured based on how it will send assertions. If
the partner is the destination site, this attribute is configured based on the
profile in which it will be receiving assertions. Following is the first part of
the procedure for configuring a trusted partner. The starting point is the SAML
screen under Federation.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>To edit or duplicate the attributes of a trusted partner profile, click the
appropriate button in the Actions column next to the configured trusted partner name.</p>
<hr>
<ol>
<li><b>Select the role (Destination or Source) of the partner site you are configuring
by checking the appropriate profile(s) used to communicate with it.</b><p>You may choose <b>Web Browser Artifact Profile</b> or <b>Web Browser Post Profile</b> for either Destination, Source or both, or
<b>SOAP Query</b> for Destination only. The choices made dictate which of the attributes in the
following steps need to be configured.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>Click Edit to change the role of the partner site if you are
modifying an existing trusted partner.</p>
<hr>
</li>
<li><b>Click Next.</b></li>
