<a name="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthmembershipservice"></a><h4>Membership</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-176"></a>The Membership Authentication module is implemented for personalized sites. When membership authentication is
enabled, a user can self-register. This means the user can create an account, personalize
it, and access it as a registered user without the help of an
administrator. The attributes are realm attributes. The attributes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#fumys">Minimum Password Length</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fumyr">Default User Roles</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fumyt">User Status After Registration</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#fumzm">Authentication Level</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="fumys"></a><h5>Minimum Password Length</h5>
<p>Specifies the minimum number of characters required for a password set during self-registration.
The default value is 8.</p><p>If this value is changed, it should also be changed in the
registration and error text in the following file:</p><p><tt></tt><i>AcessManager-base</i><tt>/locale/amAuthMembership.properties</tt>  (<i>PasswdMinChars</i> entry)</p>

<a name="fumyr"></a><h5>Default User Roles</h5>
<p>Specifies the roles assigned to new users whose profiles are created through self-registration.
There is no default value. The administrator must specify the DNs of the
roles that will be assigned to the new user.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>The role specified must be under the realm for which authentication is being
configured. Only the roles that can be assigned to the user will be
added during self-registration. All other DNs will be ignored. The role can be
either an OpenSSO role or an LDAP role, but filtered roles are not
accepted.</p>
<hr>


<a name="fumyt"></a><h5>User Status After Registration</h5>
<p>Specifies whether services are immediately made available to a user who has self-registered.
The default value is Active and services are available to the new user.
By selecting Inactive, the administrator chooses to make no services available to a
new user.</p>

<a name="fumzm"></a><h5>Authentication Level</h5>
<p>The authentication level is set separately for each method of authentication. The value
indicates how much to trust an authentication mechanism. Once a user has authenticated,
this value is stored in the SSO token for the session. When the
SSO token is presented to an application the user wants to access, the
application uses the stored value to determine whether the level is sufficient to
grant the user access. If the authentication level stored in an SSO token does
not meet the minimum value required, the application can prompt the user to
authenticate again through a service with a higher authentication level. The default value
is 0.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>If no authentication level is specified, the SSO token stores the value specified
in the Core Authentication attribute <a href="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthservice.html#fwbfn">Default Authentication Level</a>.</p>
