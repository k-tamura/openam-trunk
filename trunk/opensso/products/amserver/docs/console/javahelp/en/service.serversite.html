<a name="service.serversite"></a><h3>Servers and Sites</h3>
<p>The Servers and Sites configuration attributes allow for centralized configuration management of sites
and servers for the entire deployment. </p><p>Multiple (two or more) OpenSSO instances can be deployed on at least two
different host servers. For example, you might deploy two instances on one server
and a third instance on another server. Or you might deploy all instances
on different servers. You can also configure the OpenSSO instances in session failover
mode, if required for your deployment.</p><p>One or more load balancers route client requests to the various OpenSSO instances.
You configure each load balancer according to your deployment requirements (for example, to
use round-robin or load average) to distribute the load between the OpenSSO instances.
A load balancer simplifies the deployment, as well as resolves issues such as
a firewall between the client and the back-end OpenSSO servers.   You
can use a hardware or software load balancer with your OpenSSO deployment.  All
OpenSSO instances access the same Directory Server. </p>
