<a name="task.home"></a><h3>Common Task Components</h3>
<p>Please refer to the inline documentation or click the icon next to each
task for information on the specifics of each common task</p><p>OpenSSO contains the following work flows:</p><dl><dt>Create SAMLv2 Providers</dt>
<dd><p>This work flow allows you create identity and service provider entities based on the SAMLv2 protocol. Both provider types can be either hosted or remote. To create them, you need to provide some basic information about the providers, such as the Circle of Trust (COT) to which the provider will belong and the metadata of the provider. For general information on SAMLv2 providers, see <a href="ggwxp.html">SAMLv2 Provider Entity</a>. Otherwise, follow the inline instructions provided on each screen.</p></dd>
<dt>Create Fedlet</dt>
<dd><p>A Fedlet is a small ZIP file that can be given to a service provider to allow for immediate federation with an identity provider configured with OpenSSO. It is ideal for an identity provider that needs to enable a service provider with no federation solution in place. The service provider simply adds the Fedlet to their application, deploys their application, and they are federation enabled. Please see the <a href="http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-3885"><i>Sun OpenSSO Enterprise 8.0 Administration Guide</i></a> for information on how to deploy this application.</p></dd>
</dl>
<dl><dt>Test Federation Connectivity</dt>
<dd><p>This test will show if federation connections are being made successfully by identifying where the troubles, if any, are located.</p></dd>
<dt>Access Documentation</dt>
<dd><p>This common task option opens the OpenSSO documentation page. View frequently asked questions, tips, product documentation, engineering documentation as well as links to the community blogs.</p></dd>
<dt>Register Your Product</dt>
<dd><p>This link allows you to register your product with Sun Connection. You must have a Sun Online Account in order to complete the registration. If you do not already have one, you may request one as part of this process.</p></dd>
