<a name="service.scserviceprofile.sunfamlibertyinteractionservice"></a><h4>Liberty Interaction Service</h4>


<a name="ggofj"></a><h5>WSP to Redirect User for Interaction</h5>
<p>This attribute indicates whether the web service provider will redirect the user for
consent. The default value is yes.</p>

<a name="ggofq"></a><h5>WSP to Redirect User for Interaction for Data</h5>
<p>This initiates an interaction to get user consent or to collect additional data.
This property indicates whether the web service provider will redirect the user to
collect additional data. The default value is yes.</p>

<a name="ggogl"></a><h5>WSP's Expected Duration for Interaction</h5>
<p>This attribute indicates the length of time (in seconds) that the web service
provider expects to take to complete an interaction and return control back to
the web service client. For example, the web service provider receives a request
indicating that the web service client will wait a maximum 30 seconds (set
in WSC's Expected Duration for Interaction) for interaction. If this attribute is set
to 40 seconds, the web service provider returns a SOAP fault (<tt>timeNotSufficient</tt>), indicating
that the time is insufficient for interaction.</p>

<a name="ggogn"></a><h5>WSP to Enforce That returnToURL must be SSL</h5>
<p>This attribute indicates whether the web service provider will enforce a HTTPS <tt>returnToURL</tt>specified
by the web service client. The Liberty Alliance Project specifications state that the value
of this property is always yes. The false value is primarily meant for
ease of deployment in a phased manner.</p>

<a name="ggoib"></a><h5>WSP to Enforce Return to Host be the Same as Request Host</h5>
<p> This attribute indicates whether the web service provider would enforce the address values
of <tt>returnToHost</tt> and <tt>requestHost</tt> if they are the same. The Liberty Alliance Project
specifications state that the value of this property is always yes. The false
value is primarily meant for ease of deployment in a phased manner.</p>

<a name="ggoha"></a><h5>HTML Style Sheet Location</h5>
<p>This attribute points to the location of the style sheet that is used
to render the interaction page in HTML.</p>

<a name="ggohi"></a><h5>WML Style Sheet Location</h5>
<p>This attribute points to the location of the style sheet that is used
to render the interaction page in WML.</p>

<a name="ggogg"></a><h5>WSP Interaction URL</h5>
<p>This attribute specifies the URL where the <tt>WSPRedirectHandler</tt> servlet is deployed. The
servlet handles the service provider side of interactions for user redirects.</p>

<a name="ggoft"></a><h5>WSP Interaction URL if Behind Load Balancer</h5>
<p>Defines the WSP redirect handler URL exposed by a Load Balancer.</p>

<a name="ggogq"></a><h5>List of Interaction URLs of the WSP Cluster (site) Behind the Load Balancer</h5>
<p>Defines the WSP redirect handler URLs of trusted servers in the cluster.</p>

<a name="ggogx"></a><h5>Interaction Configuration Class</h5>
<p>This attribute specifies the class that provides access methods to read interaction configurations.</p>

<a name="ggogj"></a><h5>Options for WSC to Participate in Interaction</h5>
<p>This attribute indicates the level of interaction in which the WSC will participate
if configured to participate in user redirects. The possible values are interactIfNeeded, doNotInteract,
and doNotInteractForData. The affirmative interactIfNeeded is the default.</p>

<a name="ggogs"></a><h5>WSC to Include userInteractionHeader</h5>
<p>This attribute indicates whether the web service client will include a SOAP header
to indicate certain preferences for interaction based on the Liberty specifications. The default
value is yes.</p>

<a name="ggofn"></a><h5>WSC to redirect user for Interaction</h5>
<p>This attribute defines whether the WSC will participate in user redirections. The default
value is yes.</p>

<a name="ggoim"></a><h5>WSC's Expected Duration for Interaction</h5>
<p>This attribute defines the maximum length of time (in seconds) that the web
service client is willing to wait for the web service provider to complete
its portion of the interaction. The web service provider will not initiate an
interaction if the interaction is likely to take more time than what is
set. For example, the web service provider receives a request where this property
is set to a maximum 30 seconds. If the web service provider property
WSP's Expected Duration for Interaction is set to 40 seconds, the web service
provider returns a SOAP fault (<tt>timeNotSufficient</tt>), indicating that the time is insufficient for interaction.</p>

<a name="ggofx"></a><h5>WSC to Enforce that Redirection URL Must be SSL</h5>
<p>This attribute specifies whether the web service client will enforce HTTPS in redirected
URLs. The Liberty Alliance Project specifications state that the value of this property
is always yes, which indicates that the web service provider will not redirect
the user when the value of <tt>redirectURL</tt> (specified by the web service provider) is
not an HTTPS URL. The false value is primarily meant for easy, phased
deployment.</p>
