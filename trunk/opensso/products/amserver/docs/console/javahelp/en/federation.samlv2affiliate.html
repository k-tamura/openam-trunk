<a name="federation.samlv2affiliate"></a><h4>SAMLv2 Hosted Affiliation Customization</h4>
<p>A Hosted Affiliation contains a grouping of service providers. The affiliation is formed
and maintained by an affiliation owner who chooses the member providers from already
configured provider entities. The affiliation enables a user to federate amongst the group
of associated sites. The chosen providers may invoke services either as a member of
the affiliation, or individually as a provider. If services are invoked as an
affiliation member, a service provider might issue an authentication request for a user
on behalf of an affiliation. When authentication is secured, the user can achieve
single sign-on with all members of the affiliation. </p><p>A hosted affiliation provider holds the metadata that defines the grouping of one
or more provider entities that comprise the affiliation. It does not contain the
configuration information for any providers (which is defined in a provider entity), only
the configuration information for the affiliation itself.  If there are several service
providers and identity providers in the same circle of trust, use an affiliate entity
to avoid having to generate different name identifiers for commonly shared services. </p><p>Hosted Affiliation contains the following attributes for customization:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#ggwxt">Meta Alias</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ggwxj">Members</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="#ggwww">Cert Alias</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="ggwxt"></a><h5>Meta Alias</h5>
<p>Specifies a <tt>metaAlias</tt> for the provider being configured. The <tt>metaAlias</tt> is used to
locate the provider's entity identifier and the organization in which it is located. The
value is a string equal to the realm or organization name (dependent on
whether the SAML v2 Plug-in for Federation Services is installed in OpenSSO) coupled
with a forward slash and the provider name. For example, <tt>/suncorp/travelprovider</tt>.</p>
<hr><p><b>Caution &#8211; </b>The names used in the <tt>metaAlias</tt> must not contain a <tt>/</tt>.</p>
<hr>


<a name="ggwxj"></a><h5>Members</h5>
<p>A provider must be a member of a circle of trust, or
it cannot participate in Liberty-based communications. The provider can belong to one or more
affiliations. Enter the entity ID of the provider in the New Value field
and click Add.</p>

<a name="ggwww"></a><h5>Cert Alias</h5>
<p>This attribute defines the certificate alias elements for the provider. <tt>Signing</tt> specifies the
provider certificate alias used to find the correct signing certificate in the keystore.
<tt>Encryption</tt> specifies the provider certificate alias used to find the correct encryption certificate
in the keystore.</p>
