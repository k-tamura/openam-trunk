Building The OpenSSO MIB

The OpenSSO MIB for monitoring is supplied in SUN_OPENSSO_SERVER_MIB.mib
in the opensso/products/amserver/resources/mib directory (along with this
README).

The monitoring sources are generated using the MibGen utility, taking
SUN_OPENSSO_SERVER_MIB.mib as input.  The existing files in
optnsso/products/amserver/source/com/sun/identity/monitoring are extensions
of these generated class files.  One exception is the
SUN_OPENSSO_SERVER_MIB.java file, where the generated file has been
modified.

The "am-mib" target in opensso/products/build.xml does the following:
  1. unzips extlib/jdmk51_02-allplatforms.zip to ${amserver.built.dir}/mib
  2. unzips ${amserver.built.dir}/mib/sun-jdmk-sdk-5.1-b34.2.zip to
     ${amserver.built.dir}/mib
  3. unzips ${amserver.built.dir}/mib/sun-jdmk-runtime-5.1-b34.2.zip
      to ${amserver.built.dir}/mib
  4. unzips ${amserver.built.dir}/mib/sun-jdmk-runtime-jmx-5.1-b34.2.zip
     to ${amserver.built.dir}/mib
  5. invokes com.sun.jdmk.tools.MibGen on SUN_OPENSSO_SERVER_MIB.mib,
     directing sources to ${amserver.built.dir}/mib
  6. copies ${amserver.built.dir}/mib/*.java to
     amserver/com/sun/identity/monitoring, except for
     SUN_OPENSSO_SERVER_MIB.java.
