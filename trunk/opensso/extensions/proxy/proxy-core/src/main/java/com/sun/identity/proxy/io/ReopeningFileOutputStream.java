/**
 * An output stream for writing data to a file, reopening the file as necessary.
 * <p>
 * This class provides the same basic functionality as a
 * {@link FileOutputStream}, with the exception that it can detect the removal
 * of the underlying file, and reopen for writing as necessary. This is useful
 * for logging for example, where a log file may be removed in automatic log
 * rotation (as opposed to being truncated).
 * <p>
 * Note: checking for the presence of the file for each write operation adds
 * overhead and depends on the efficiency of the operating system platform it
 * is deployed on. Writing arrays of bytes is far more efficient than writing
 * individual bytes.
