PHPClientSDK - Current status
##########################################################

* code works for extracting token from http request, validating against an OpenSSO server, getting (some) properties - not all methods are actually implemented

* setting properties on token seems to make trouble: investigate why

PHPClientSDK - How to test
##########################################################

* working OpenSSO server deployed somewhere (only localhost tested)
* working apache web server with php 5 support (only localhost tested)
* change AMConfig.properties location in test.php around line 66
* first login to OpenSSO
* then visit test.php: token id should be displayed along with principal name
