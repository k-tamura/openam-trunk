# Property definitions.
# Note: The list of schema attributes for each datastore type corresponds to the
#       list of user schema files on the same datastore type and it should be in
#       sequence order.  For example,  if schemalist=file1;file2 and
#       attribute=attr1;attr2,  attr1 will be used to check for schema in file1
#       and attr2 will be used for schema in file2. To skip the schema checking,
#       leave the attribute entry empty or don't specify if the attribute is the
# 	the last entry on the list.
