 <title>Customizing the OpenAM End User Pages</title>
 
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Custom end user pages</primary>
 </indexterm>
 <para>When you deploy OpenAM to protect your web-based applications, users
 can be redirected to OpenAM pages for login and logout. ForgeRock provides
 pages localized for English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean,
 Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese, but you might require additional
 language support for your organization.</para>
 
 <para>Also, by default the end user pages have ForgeRock styling and branding.
 You likely want to change at least the images to reflect your organization.
 You might want to have different page customizations for different realms as
 well. This chapter address how to get started customizing OpenAM end user
 pages for your organizations and supported locales.</para>
 
 <para>First you copy the pages to customize to the proper location, then
 you customize the files themselves.</para>
 
 <para>Images in this example are located in
 <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/images/</filename>, and CSS in
 <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/css/</filename>. If you choose
 to modify images for your deployment, you can maintain the sizes to avoid
 having to customize page layout extensively.</para>
 
 <tip>
  <para>The procedures below describe how to update a deployed version of
  OpenAM, so that you can see your changes without redeploying the application.
  This approach works for development. For production deployment, however,
  you must package your changes in a custom OpenAM deployable .war file.</para>
  <para>When developing with a web container that deploys OpenAM in a temporary
  location, such as JBoss or Jetty, restarting the container can also overwrite
  your changes with the deployable .war content. For those web containers, you
  should also prepare a deployable .war containing your changes, and redeploy
  that file to check your work.</para>
  <para>To create a deployable .war, unpack the OpenAM .war file from
  <filename>/path/to/OpenAM/deployable-war</filename> into a staging directory,
  do your work in that staging directory, and then use the
  <command>createwar.sh</command> or <command>createwar.bat</command>
  script to prepare the deployable .war.</para>
 </tip>
 
 <procedure xml:id="copy-ui-to-customize-top-level-realm">
  <title>To Copy the Pages to Customize For the Top-Level Realm</title>
  <para>Rather than change the default pages, customize your own copy.</para>
  <step>
   <para>Change to the <filename>config/auth</filename> directory where
   you deployed OpenAM.</para>
   <screen>$ cd /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/config/auth</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Copy the default files and optionally the localized files to
   <filename>openam[_<replaceable>locale</replaceable>]/html</filename>,
   where the optional <replaceable>locale</replaceable> is, for example,
   <literal>jp</literal> for Japanese, or <literal>zh_CN</literal> for
   Simplified Chinese.</para>
   <para>The following example copies the files for the Top-Level Realm
   (<literal>/</literal>) for a custom French locale.</para>
   <screen>$ mkdir -p openam/html
$ cp -r default/* openam/html
$ mkdir -p openam_fr/html
$ cp -r default_fr/* openam_fr/html</screen>
  </step>
 </procedure>
 
 <procedure xml:id="copy-ui-to-customize-subrealm">
  <title>To Copy the Pages to Customize For Another Realm</title>
  <para>As for the top-level realm, customize your copy rather than the
  default pages.</para>
  <step>
   <para>Change to the <filename>config/auth</filename> directory where
   you deployed OpenAM.</para>
   <screen>$ cd /path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/config/auth</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Depending on which locale you want to customize, copy the default
   files and optionally the localized files to <filename>openam[_<replaceable>locale</replaceable
     >]/services/<replaceable>realm</replaceable>/html</filename>.</para>
   <para>The following example copies the files for a custom French locale and
   a realm named <literal>ventes</literal>.</para>
   <screen>$ mkdir -p openam/html
$ cp -r default/* openam/services/ventes/html
$ mkdir -p openam_fr/services/ventes/html
$ cp -r default_fr/* openam_fr/services/ventes/html</screen>

 <procedure xml:id="customize-ui-copy">
  <title>To Customize Files You Copied</title>
  <para>The .jsp files from the <filename>default/</filename> directory
  reference the images used in the OpenAM pages, and retrieve localized text
  from the .xml files. Thus you customize appearance through the .jsp files,
  being careful not to change the functionality itself. You customize the
  localized text through the .xml files.</para>
  <step>
   <para>Modify appearance if you must by editing the .jsp, image, and
   CSS files without changing any of the JSP tags that govern how the pages
   work.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Modify the localized text, using UTF-8 without escaped characters, by
   changing only the original text strings in the .xml files.</para>
   <para>For example, to change the text in the default OpenAM login screen in
   the top-level realm for the French locale, edit
   <filename>openam_fr/html/DataStore.xml</filename>.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>If necessary, restart OpenAM or the web container to test the changes
   you have made.</para>
   <para>The following screen shot shows a customized French login page
   where the string <literal>Nom d'utilisateur</literal> has been replaced
   with the string <literal>Votre identifiant</literal>, and the string
   <literal>Mot de passe</literal> has been replaced with the string
   <literal>Votre mot de passe</literal> in
