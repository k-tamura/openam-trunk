 <part label="A">
  <title>Overview</title>
  <partintro>
   <para>Although policy agents and standards support make it possible for
   applications to use OpenAM for access management without changing your
   code, some deployments require tighter integration, or direct use of
   supported protocols and OpenAM APIs.</para>
   
   <para>OpenAM supports a range of protocols and APIs that allow you not
   only to define specifically how access is managed in your client
   applications, but also to extend OpenAM capabilities to meet even
   those deployment requirements not yet covered in OpenAM.</para>

  <title>Developing Client Applications</title>
  <partintro>
   <para>Client applications access OpenAM services for authentication,
   authorization, and single sign on/single log out through the use of
   sessions. Client applications can also be allowed to manage authorization
   policies.</para>
   
   <para>Client application integration with OpenAM can be coupled loosely,
   as in the case of an application running in a web server with an OpenAM
   policy agent to handle interaction with OpenAM service, more directly,
   as in the case where the client interacts with OpenAM over protocol, or
   tightly, as in the case of an application using the OpenAM Java or C API
   to interact with OpenAM services.</para>
   
   <para>This part of the guide covers client interaction with OpenAM
   over supported protocols and using OpenAM APIs.</para>

  <title>Extending OpenAM</title>
  <partintro>
   <para>OpenAM services solve a wide range of access and federation
   management problems out of the box. Yet, OpenAM also exposes APIs and
   SPIs that enable you extend OpenAM services when built-in functionality
   does not fit your deployment.</para>
   
   <para>This part of the guide covers OpenAM mechanisms for plugging in
   additional functionality not available out of the box.</para>
