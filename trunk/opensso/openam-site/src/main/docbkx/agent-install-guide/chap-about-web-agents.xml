 <title>OpenAM Web Policy Agents</title>

 <para>This chapter covers what web policy agents do and how they work.</para>
 
 <para>A <firstterm>policy agent</firstterm> enforces policy for OpenAM. A
 <firstterm>web policy agent</firstterm> installed in a web server intercepts
 requests from users trying to access a protected web resource, and denies
 access until the user has authorization from OpenAM to access the
 resource.</para>
 
 <section xml:id="example-agent-interaction">
  <title>How the User, Web Policy Agent, &amp; OpenAM Interact</title>
  
  <para>Imagine that a user attempts to access a protected resource before
  having authenticated by pointing her browser to a web page. Assume that you
  have configured OpenAM to protect the web page. Then the web policy agent
  intercepting her browser's request finds no session token in the request,
  and so redirects the user's browser to the OpenAM login page for
  authentication. After the user has successfully authenticated, OpenAM
  sets a session token in a browser cookie, and redirects her browser back to
  the page she tried to access initially.</para>
  
  <para>When the user's browser reiterates the request, the policy agent again
  checks that the request has a session token, finds a session token this
  time, and validates the session token with OpenAM. Given the valid session
  token, the policy agents gets a policy decision from OpenAM concerning whether
  the user can access the page. If OpenAM's Policy Service determines that
  the user is allowed to access the page, OpenAM responds to the policy agent
  that access should be granted. The web policy agent then permits the web
  page to be returned to the user's browser.</para>
 </section>
 
 <section xml:id="web-agent-configuration">
  <title>How Web Policy Agents are Configured</title>
  
  <para>You install web policy agents in the web servers holding web resources
  that you want to protect. By default, the web policy agent has only enough
  configuration at installation time to connect to OpenAM in order to get the
  rest of its configuration from the OpenAM configuration store. With nearly
  all configuration stored centrally, you can manage policy agents centrally
  from the OpenAM console.</para>
  
  <para>You can opt to store the agent configuration locally if necessary.
  If you store the configuration locally, then avoid issues with the
  configuration by making sure you provide valid values for configuration
  properties ending in the following.</para>

  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>You configure web policy agents per realm. Thus to access centralized
  configuration, you select Access Control &gt; <replaceable>Realm
  Name</replaceable> &gt; Agents &gt; Web &gt; <replaceable>Agent
  Name</replaceable>. Web policy agent configuration is distinct from
  policy configuration. The only policy-like configuration that you apply to
  web policy agents is indicating which URLs in the web server can be
  ignored (<firstterm>not enforced URLs</firstterm>) and which client IP
  address are exempt from policy enforcement (<firstterm>not enforced
  IPs</firstterm>).</para>
  
  <para>For each aspect of web policy agent configuration, you can configure
  the policy agent through the OpenAM console during testing, and then
  export the resulting configuration in order to script configuration in
  your production environment.</para>
