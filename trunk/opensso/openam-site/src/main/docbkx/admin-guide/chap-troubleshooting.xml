    <question>
     <para>OpenAM configuration could not write to the configuration directory.
     Where must I change permissions, and what permissions are required?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>If the user running the web container has a $HOME directory, then
     the configuration directory is stored there, and you probably do not have
     this problem. If you do not know the user running the web container, use
     the <command>ps</command> command to check. In the following example, the
     user is <literal>mark</literal>, the web container
     <literal>tomcat</literal>.</para>
     <screen>$ ps -ef | grep tomcat
mark      1739     1  0 14:47...</screen>
     <para>For a container installed from native packages with a dedicated
     user, $HOME may not be where you think it is. Look at the user's entry in
     <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> to locate the home directory.
     The user running the web container where you install OpenAM must
     be able to read from and write in this directory.</para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry>
   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>Deployment failed due to lack of memory. What do I do?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>OpenAM requires at least a maximum heap size of 1024 MB, with a 256
     MB maximum permanent generation heap size. For the Sun JVM, ensure the
     container starts with <literal>-Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m</literal>
     for these settings.</para>
     <para>If you do not know the settings used when the web container was
     started, use the <command>ps</command> command to check. In the following
     example, the web container is <literal>tomcat</literal>.</para>
     <screen>$ ps -ef | grep tomcat | grep Xm
... -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=256m ...</screen>
     <para>You can also look for memory errors in OpenAM by searching the
     <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/debug/*</filename>
     files for <literal>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError</literal>.</para>
     <para>Make sure you have at least 2 GB of RAM on the system where you
     run OpenAM to avoid running out of memory.</para>
    </answer>
   </qandaentry>
   <qandaentry>
    <question>
     <para>Deployment failed due to invalid hostname configuration. What do
     I do?</para>
    </question>
    <answer>
     <para>OpenAM requires that you use a fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
     that the host can resolve.</para>
     <screen>$ ping openam-ter.example.com
PING openam-ter (192.168.56.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from openam (192.168.56.2): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.025 ms
64 bytes from openam (192.168.56.2): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.032 ms
64 bytes from openam (192.168.56.2): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.030 ms</screen>
     <para>For a test deployment (at home, on a laptop), you can use fake FQDNs
     in <filename>/etc/hosts</filename>, depending on how your network is
     configured.</para>
     <screen>$ cat /etc/hosts | grep openam
192.168.56.2 openam openam.example.com
192.168.56.3 openam-bis openam-bis.example.com
192.168.56.5 openam-ter openam-ter.example.com</screen>
