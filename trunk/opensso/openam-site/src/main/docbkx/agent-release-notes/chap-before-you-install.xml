 <title>Before You Install OpenAM Policy Agents</title>

 <para>This chapter covers software and hardware prerequisites for installing
 and running OpenAM Policy Agents.</para>

 <para>TODO: Import the relevant information from
 https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/OpenAM+Policy+Agents+3.0.4+supported
 modulo changes in particular for test plans.</para>

 <para>Apache web agents require Apache Portable Runtime 1.3.x or later. You
 can check your installation by running <command>httpd -v</command>. On some
 systems, the packaged version of Apache HTTPD uses earlier versions of APR
 that are not compatible with the current web agents.</para>

 <para>Before installing web policy agents on Solaris 10, make sure you have
 applied the latest shared library patch for C++, at least 119963-16 on SPARC,
 or 119964-12 on x86.</para>
