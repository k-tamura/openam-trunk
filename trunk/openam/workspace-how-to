      WEB-INF/lib or they are to be used for compilation only.
      a. add the binary file names to external.lib property in
         products.properties file under this directory if they need to be
         bundled in WAR
      b. add the binary file names to build.lib property in
         products.properties file under this directory if they are to be 
         used for compilation only.

2. Keep ant build XML file clean
   a. Try not to duplicate resources
      Please keep on copy of the resourcs required and not copying them in 
      different places in the workspace.
