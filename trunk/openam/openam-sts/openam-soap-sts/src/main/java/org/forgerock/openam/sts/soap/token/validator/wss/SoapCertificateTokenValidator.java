/**
 * This class extends the Apache WSS4j TokenValidator deployed by Apache CXF to validate x509 tokens presented as part
 * of consuming an STS instance protected by SecurityPolicy bindings specifying an x509 ProtectionToken. This class will
 * integrate this validation with OpenAM by consuming the OpenAM REST authN functionality.
 *
 * This validation functionality will only augment the existing CXF validation functionality to determine whether the
 * included certs are present in the OpenAM LDAP certificate store.
 *
 * In the soap-sts, the validity of the caller asserting its identity via presenting a x509 cert
 * (SecurityPolicyExamples 2.2.1 and 2.2.2) will be insured because messages sent to the caller will be encrypted using the
 * caller's public key. In this case, only trust needs to be established - something which this class, by virtue of
 * extending the SignatureTrustValidator, provides. It may be a configuration option whether this class should
 * consume the OpenAM Certificate module, so that the additional invocation against the OpenAM Certificate module, performed
 * by the AuthenticationHandler<X509Certificate>, should be performed.
