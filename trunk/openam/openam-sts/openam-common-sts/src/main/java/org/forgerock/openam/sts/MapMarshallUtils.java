/**
 * This class encapsulates a set of public static methods to aid in marshalling Rest and Soap STS instance config state,
 * ultimately a json native format, into the Map<String, Set<String>> of attributes required for SMS persistence. As part
 * of this conversion, a Map<String, Object>, returned from JsonValue.asMap, must be transformed into a Map<String, Set<String>>.
 * Likewise, when going in the other direction (SMS map to JsonValue), the Map<String, Set<String>> needs to be converted
 * back to a Map<String,Object> so that a JsonValue can be constructed therefrom.
 *
 * Static methods cannot be mocked (without bcel), and thus should be kept to a minimum. The preferred guice interface/implementation
 * method was not adopted because this method is consumed from the config/user classes, like RestSTSInstanceConfig, which
 * do not have dependencies injected, as they define a client SDK, which facilitates the programmatic publishing of
 * STS instances.
