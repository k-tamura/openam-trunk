/**
 * The TokenProviderResponse instance returned by the CXF-STS TokenProvider instances represents the token as a
 * org.w3c.dom.Element. It is likely that the REST-STS will only return json, and thus the XML elements corresponding
 * to an e.g. SAML token will likely be returned in a json value. This interface defines the functionality necessary
 * to create this json value. Other token types may not have a native xml format, yet will represent their generated tokens
 * as XML, due to the contract demanded by the TokenProviderResponse. This interface implementation will also marshal
 * these token types, which do not mandate a native xml format, from xml to json.
 *
 * It may be decided that either xml or json can be returned from the REST-STS - if so, the interface will be enhanced with
 * the specification of the returned type.
 *
 * TODO: it may make sense to return a JsonValue from this interface - for now, a String will be returned. Furthermore,
 * it probably makes sense to return any token encapsulated in a jws signed by the STS' signing key, and the contents of this
 * jws may well be a jwt, which contains the SAML assertion. These issues will be resolved in a future story. For now,
 * the REST STS will simply return issued tokens as an xml string.
