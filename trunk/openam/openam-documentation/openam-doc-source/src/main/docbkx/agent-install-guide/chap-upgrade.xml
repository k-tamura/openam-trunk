  <para>Follow these steps to upgrade a version 3 policy agent to
  a more recent version 3 release.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Backup the file system directory where the existing agent is
   installed.</para>
   <para>In other words when upgrading a web policy agent, backup the
   <filename>web_agents/</filename> directory. For Java EE policy agents,
   back up the <filename>j2ee_agents/</filename> directory.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Extract the .zip for the new release over the existing agent files,
   replacing the current version with the new version.</para>

   <para>When upgrading a Java EE agent, replace the deployed agent
   application with the new version.</para>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Restart the web server, web container, or policy agent.</para>
   <para>At this point, new configuration parameters introduced since the
   release of the earlier policy agent have not yet been set, and so the
   policy agent uses the default values until you change the
   configuration.</para>
  </step>
 </procedure>

 <procedure xml:id="revert-same-major-version">

   version you backed up.</para>
