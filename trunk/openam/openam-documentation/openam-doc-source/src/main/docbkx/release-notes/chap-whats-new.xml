 <title>What's New in OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?></title>

 <para>OpenAM <?eval ${currentMajorVersion}?> fixes a number of issues, and
 provides the following additional features.</para>

 <important>
  <para>This Xpress release is a milestone release from the main development
  branch of the product. It precedes the full enterprise release, and contains
  selected key features (as well as all current fixed issues).</para>

  <para>This Xpress release has undergone functional testing, but not been
  passed the complete battery of tests that ForgeRock performs for a full
  enterprise release.</para>

  <para>You can purchase a ForgeRock support subscription for this Xpress
  release. However, there is no long-term support for Xpress releases. Instead,
  you must upgrade to the final enterprise release for full long-term
  support.</para>

  <para>An Xpress release allows you to begin the proof-of-concept and build
  phases earlier with the most recent features, instead of waiting for the
  enterprise release, yet still get support and fixes from ForgeRock. Fixes to
  issues discovered on Xpress releases are done by engineering directly in the
  open source project repository, and thus guaranteed to be delivered in the
  enterprise release that follow.</para>

  <title>Major New Features</title>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now provides much richer support for OAuth 2.0. In addition
   to playing the role of client and resource server, OpenAM can now also
   play the role of OAuth 2.0 authorization server. See <link
   xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-oauth2"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managing OAuth
   2.0 Authorization</citetitle></link> for explanations, instructions,
   and examples.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Session failover and system session high-availability have been
   modified to be simpler to implement (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-625"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-625</link>). OpenAM 10.0.1 and earlier required the
   use of Open Message Queue and Berkeley DB Java Edition, which increased the
   complexity and amount of time required to get session failover working.
   OpenAM now writes session data to the configuration data store instead of a
   message queue. This implementation also can be used to make sessions persist
   across restart for single OpenAM servers.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>IBM<superscript>®</superscript> WebSphere<superscript>®</superscript>
   8.0 is now a supported platform. See <link
   xlink:href="install-guide#prepare-ibm-websphere"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Preparing IBM
   WebSphere</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>
   for details on how to setup WebSphere 8.0 and 8.5 before deploying 
   OpenAM.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Legacy naming conventions have been changed to conform to the
   current product name, OpenAM. This includes the OpenAM bootstrap file
   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1555"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1555</link>). <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>
   is the new name for <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>. If you upgrade,
   OpenAM still supports use of <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>, and
   does not rename the folder. For new OpenAM installs, OpenAM creates the
   directory with the new name, <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>, at
   configuration time. Other files, such as the <filename>openam.war</filename>
   file, and paths have been modified to ensure consistency with the naming
   conventions.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now supports Open Authentication (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-727"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-727</link>). The module provides the user with a
   one-time password based either on a HMAC one-time password or a time-based
   one-time password. OATH lets you determine which type of one-time password
   is best for your users when they need to login with a password generating
   device. Devices can range from a smartphone or a dedicated device, such as
   YubiKey. It uses the the standard that allows authentication to occur from
   a single protocol.</para>

   <para>With OATH, OpenAM now supports YubiKey<superscript>®</superscript>
   authentication. The YubiKey simplifies the process of logging in with a One
   Time Password token as it does not require the user to re-type long pass
   codes from a display device into the login field of the computer. The
   YubiKey is inserted in the USB-port of any computer and the OTP is generated
   and automatically entered with a simple touch of a button on the YubiKey,
   and without the need of any client software or drivers.</para>

   set an account expiration date on successful login.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>

  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>When running as a Service Provider, OpenAM no longer requires
   that you enable module-based authentication (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1470"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1470</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>The OATH authentication module now implements resynchronization
   for TOTP (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1462"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1462</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now better supports using a reverse proxy for federation
   when DAS is also deployed (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1454"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1454</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now allows use of a read-only data store with a non-transient
   NameID during SAML 2.0 federation (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1427"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1427</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>The ssoadm command now includes a get-sub-cfg subcommand (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1348"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1348</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>The REST authenticate command now has a client parameter (<link
    xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1048"
    xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1048</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM builds are now also uploaded as Maven artifacts to the ForgeRock
   Maven repository (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-739"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-739</link>).</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>For SAML 2.0, modify the templates
    <link xlink:href="http://sources.forgerock.org/browse/openam/trunk/openam/openam-federation/openam-federation-library/src/main/resources/saml2login.template?r=HEAD"
    xlink:show="new"><filename>saml2login.template</filename></link>
    and
    <link xlink:href="http://sources.forgerock.org/browse/openam/trunk/openam/openam-federation/openam-federation-library/src/main/resources/saml2loginwithrelay.template?r=HEAD"
    xlink:show="new"><filename>saml2loginwithrelay.template</filename></link>
    to change the presentation, retaining the form and JavaScript. Then copy
    your templates under the <filename>WEB-INF/classes/</filename> directory
    where you unpacked the OpenAM web application (for example
    <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/classes/</filename>).</para>
  </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>You can now prevent OpenAM from caching subject evaluations for
    policy decisions (part of the fix for <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-24"
    >OPENAM-24</link>).</para>
    <para>In most cases you do not need to turn off caching, as OpenAM now
    clears cache when group membership changes. Before turning off caching in
    production, first test the setting to ensure that the performance impact is
    acceptable for your deployment.</para>
    <para>To turn off caching, set Access Control &gt; <replaceable
    >Realm Name</replaceable> &gt; Services &gt; Policy Configuration &gt;
    Subjects Result Time to Live to 0. The equivalent
    <command>ssoadm</command> property for the
    <literal>iPlanetAMPolicyConfigService</literal> is
    <literal>iplanet-am-policy-config-subjects-result-ttl</literal>.</para>
