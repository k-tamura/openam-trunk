 <title>What's New in OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?></title>

 <para>OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?> fixes a number of issues, and
 provides the following additional features.</para>

 <important>
  <para>OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?> is a milestone release
  from the main development branch of the product. The Xpress release contains
  selected key features and all current fixed issues. An Xpress release
  undergoes important functional testing but not the complete testing cycle
  that is done for a full Enterprise release.</para>

  <para>Xpress releases are supported through ForgeRock subscriptions and are
  upgradeable to the Enterprise version, which has long term support.</para>

  <para>The goal of an Xpress release is to enable you to start build phases
  earlier, with the most recent features, instead of having to wait for the
  Enterprise release date. Fixes to issues that are discovered in an Xpress
  release are delivered as patches to ForgeRock customers, and are guaranteed
  to be delivered in the Enterprise release that follows. Xpress releases are
  supported for a grace period after the Enterprise version has been
  released.</para>

  <para>With the exception of these Release Notes, the official documentation
  for this release is still in progress, and is accessible at
  <link xlink:href="http://openam.forgerock.org/docs.html" xlink:show="new"
  >http://openam.forgerock.org/docs.html</link>. The complete, validated
  documentation set will be available with the Enterprise release.</para>

  <title>Major New Features</title>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now provides further support for OAuth 2.0. In addition
   to playing the role of client and resource server, OpenAM can now also
   play the role of OAuth 2.0 authorization server. See <link
   xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-oauth2"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Managing OAuth
   2.0 Authorization</citetitle></link> for explanations, instructions,
   and examples.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Session failover has been modified to be simpler to deploy (<link
   xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-625"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-625</link>). OpenAM 10.0.1 and earlier required the
   use of Open Message Queue and Berkeley DB Java Edition, which increased the
   complexity and amount of time required to get session failover working.
   OpenAM now writes session data to the configuration data store instead.
   This implementation also can be used to make sessions persist across restart
   for single OpenAM servers. The current implementation requires that you use
   OpenDJ for the configuration data store.</para>

   <para>This new implementation is designed to operate on a local site network.
   Cross-site session failover and session failover across wide area networks
   (WANs) are not supported.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>IBM<superscript>®</superscript> WebSphere<superscript>®</superscript>
   8.0 is now a supported platform. See <link
   xlink:href="install-guide#prepare-ibm-websphere"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Preparing IBM
   WebSphere</citetitle></link> in the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle>
   for details on how to setup WebSphere 8.0 and 8.5 before deploying 
   OpenAM.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>Legacy naming conventions have been changed to conform to the
   current product name, OpenAM. This includes the OpenAM bootstrap file
   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1555"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1555</link>). <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>
   is the new name for <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>. If you upgrade,
   OpenAM still supports use of <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>, and
   does not rename the folder. For new OpenAM installs, OpenAM creates the
   directory with the new name, <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>, at
   configuration time. Other files, such as the <filename>openam.war</filename>
   file, and paths have been modified to ensure consistency with the naming
   conventions.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>OpenAM now supports <link xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="http://www.openauthentication.org/">Open Authentication</link>
   (<link xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-727"
   xlink:show="new">OPENAM-727</link>). The module provides the user with a
   one-time password based either on a HMAC one-time password or a time-based
   one-time password. OATH lets you determine which type of one-time password
   is best for your users when they need to login with a password generating
   device. Devices can range from a smartphone to a dedicated device, such as
   YubiKey or any other OATH compliant device.</para>

   <para>With OATH, OpenAM now supports YubiKey<superscript>®</superscript>
   authentication. The YubiKey simplifies the process of logging in with a One
   Time Password token as it does not require the user to re-type long pass
   codes from a display device into the login field of the computer. The
   YubiKey is inserted in the USB-port of any computer and the OTP is generated
   and automatically entered with a simple touch of a button on the YubiKey,
   and without the need of any client software or drivers.</para>

   <para>OpenAM is now built with Maven. Maven artifacts continue to be uploaded

   <listitem>
    <para>You can now prevent OpenAM from caching subject evaluations for
    policy decisions (part of the fix for <link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-24"
    >OPENAM-24</link>).</para>
    <para>In most cases you do not need to turn off caching, as OpenAM now
    clears cache when group membership changes. Before turning off caching in
    production, first test the setting to ensure that the performance impact is
    acceptable for your deployment.</para>
    <para>To turn off caching, set Access Control &gt; <replaceable
    >Realm Name</replaceable> &gt; Services &gt; Policy Configuration &gt;
    Subjects Result Time to Live to 0. The equivalent
    <command>ssoadm</command> property for the
