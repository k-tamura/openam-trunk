 <para>This chapter covers both major changes to existing functionality, and
 also deprecated and removed functionality.</para>

  <title>Major Changes to Existing Functionality</title>

  <itemizedlist>

   <!-- OPENAM-2051: Document the OpenAM suffix configuration changes -->
   <listitem>
    <para>When you create a new OpenAM custom configuration that uses an
    external LDAP directory server for the configuration data store, you must
    use a root suffix DN with at least two domain components, such as
    <literal>dc=example,dc=com</literal>.</para>
   </listitem>

   <!-- Not in XPress
     <listitem>
      <para>The advanced server property used to set the HTTP header name,
      <literal>com.sun.identity.authentication.client.ipAddressHeader </literal>,
      has replaced the legacy OpenSSO property
      <literal>com.sun.identity.session.httpClientIPHeader</literal> (<link
      xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENAM-1879"
      xlink:show="new">OPENAM-1879</link>).</para>
     </listitem>
   -->
   <listitem>
    <para>Legacy naming conventions have been changed to conform to the
    current product name, OpenAM.</para>

    <para><filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename> is the new name for
    <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>. If you upgrade, OpenAM still
    supports use of <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/</filename>, and does not
    rename the folder. For new OpenAM installs, OpenAM creates the directory
    with the new name, <filename>$HOME/.openamcfg/</filename>, at configuration
    time.</para>

    <para>Other files, such as the <filename>openam.war</filename> file, and
    paths have been modified to ensure consistency with the naming
    conventions.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM now ships with multiple .war files. You no longer have to
    build custom .war files for core server-only or distributed authentication
    UI installations for example.</para>
   </listitem>

<!-- Fix for OpenAM-699
   <listitem>
    <para>RSA has marked the RSA Authentication API used in earlier versions of
    OpenAM as End of Life. The current API version used in OpenAM is now 8.1.
    As a result, OpenAM now supports RSA Authentication Manager versions 6.1.2
    and 7.1.</para>
   </listitem>
 -->

   <listitem>
    <para>Privileged console access is now disabled by default. To enable
    privileged console access for specific users, set the
    <literal>console.privileged.users</literal> advanced property as described
    in the <citetitle>OpenAM Reference</citetitle> section, <link
    xlink:href="reference#servers-advanced-configuration"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Servers &gt;
    Advanced</citetitle></link>.</para>
   </listitem>

   <!-- Fix for OPENAM-1578 -->
   <listitem>
    <para>In earlier versions the default root suffix DN for OpenAM
    configuration and profile data was
    <literal>dc=opensso,dc=java,dc=net</literal>.
    The default root suffix is now
    <literal><?eval ${defaultRootSuffix}?></literal>.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="deprecated">
  <title>Deprecated Functionality</title>
  
  <para>The following functionality is deprecated in OpenAM
  <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?>, and is likely to be removed in a future
  release.</para>

  <itemizedlist>

   <listitem>
    <para>With the implementation of OAuth 2.0 in this release, OAuth 1.0 has been 
    deprecated. OAuth 1.0 support was originally provided in OpenAM 9.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>The Netscape LDAP API is to be removed from OpenAM, with OpenAM
    using the OpenDJ LDAP SDK instead. This affects all classes in
    <literal>com.sun.identity.shared.ldap.*</literal> packages.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>OpenAM currently uses Sun Java System Application Framework (JATO).
    JATO is deprecated and is likely to be replaced in a future release.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
 </section>

 <section xml:id="removed">
  <title>Removed Functionality</title>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>For OpenAM <?eval ${serverDocTargetVersion}?>, the use of the
    previous session failover implementation has been removed.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>With the updated session failover, SAML 2 and session persistence have
    changed. The methods used prior to OpenAM 10.1.0 are no longer
    available.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <!-- Fix for OpenAM-837 -->
    <para>Support for Liberty Identity Web Services Framework (ID-WSF) has been
    removed.</para>
