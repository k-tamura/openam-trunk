 <title>About Policy Agent Properties</title>
 <para>All policy agent configuration settings are stored centrally by default
  in the OpenAM configuration store, which allows you
  to configure your policy agents on the OpenAM console for easier management and
  convenience.
  Any property change made
  in OpenAM using the console or the <command>ssoadm</command> command-line tool is
  immediately communicated to the agent via a notification.
  Many policy agent properties are hot-swap enabled, allowing the change
  to take effect immediately without a server restart.
 </para>
 <para>Policy agent configuration settings can also be stored locally in a
  Java properties flat-file, such as
  <filename>Agent_001/config/${agentsConfigurationFile}</filename>,
  which is created when you install the agent.
  If you implement a local properties file, you must make all
  configuration changes by modifying property values in the file.
 </para>
 <para>While the majority of agent properties are hot swap-enabled, there are
  a number that are not. These non-hot swappable properties are indicated in the
  OpenAM console or local properties file as such. Any changes to these non-hot swappable
  properties require a container restart. To avoid any configuration errors that
  could take effect immediately, you can lock the properties by setting the
  <literal>com.sun.identity.agents.config.lock.enable</literal> to <literal>true</literal>
  in the OpenAM bootstrap file, <filename>${agentsBootstrapFile}</filename>,
  and then re-start the container.
