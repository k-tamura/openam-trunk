 <title>Upgrading Basics</title>
 <indexterm><primary>Upgrading</primary></indexterm>

 <para>This chapter shows you how to upgrade OpenAM core services. Starting
 with OpenAM 10.0.0 and later versions, OpenAM supports schema changes as 
 part of an upgrade, so you may need to run the upgrade wizard at the end of the 
 upgrade process. The wizard will automatically write all necessary changes to the 
 configuration store and will prompt you to restart the container.</para>
 
 <para>There are two ways to upgrade your deployment: using the defaults and 
 adding the customized files. You should try the default upgrade in a test
 environment before you apply it to a production environment. ForgeRock also
 recommends working on the customized version in a test environment before
 updating a productions version so that you will be aware of any potential
 issues that you may encounter with your customized version.</para>
 
<!-- TO DO <para>Working with multiple instances of OpenAM requires some variations to 
 the procedures, as noted below. An additional procedure is included if you 
 want to complete an upgrade without downtime.</para>
 -->
 <note>
  <para>ForgeRock strongly recommend that you do not expose an OpenAM instance to
  users during the upgrade process since running the wizard does not require
  authorization.</para>
 </note>

<!--
 <note>
  <para>Following an update to OpenAM 10.1.0 Xpress, all users will
  need to login again because OpenAM no longer uses Open Message Queue or 
  Berkeley DB Java Edition for session failover. </para>
 </note>

  <title>To Upgrade From OpenAM 9.1 Or Later</title>
  
  <para>ForgeRock has considerably simplified OpenAM core services upgrade
  with respect to earlier versions. If you have one instance that is OpenAM 9.1

  next version of OpenAM.</para>

<!--  Needs testing
 <procedure xml:id="upgrade-multiple-instances-procedure">
  <title>Upgrading Multiple OpenAM Instances To OpenAM 10.0.0 Without Downtime</title>
  <para>If you need to keep all of your instances of OpenAM up and running
  you can upgrade all of them without having any lapse in service. If you have
  a functional session failover system, user sessions will be preserved throughout
  and after the upgrade process.</para>

  <para>If you need to reinstall the session tools, a cold restart of the session 
  failover system is required. This means that all sessions will be stopped from 
  the session database cluster, and most or all of your users will lose their 
  active sessions and will need to login again. ForgeRock advise you to carry out a complete
  upgrade with the tools in a maintenance window.</para>
  
  <para>If the internal representation of session objects is significantly changed
  between versions ForgeRock recommends you preform a cold restart of your session 
  failover cluster to remove old sessions.</para>
  
  <para>If you are upgrading all of your instances without upgrading the tools,
  use the following procedure to upgrade without any downtime for your users.
  The procedure is based four servers (A, B, C, and D).</para>
  
  <step>
   <para>Remove servers A and B from the load balancer.</para>
  </step>
  
  <step>
   <para>Break the following replication agreements in OpenDJ so that you will
   have two separate OpenDJ clusters: A(C,D); B(C,D); C(A,B); D(A,B).</para>

   restart it.</para>

  <step>
   <para>Follow the instructions upgrading an instance for servers B and 
   restart it. You will not need to run the upgrade wizard since it
   will automatically replicate the configuration from servers A.</para>
