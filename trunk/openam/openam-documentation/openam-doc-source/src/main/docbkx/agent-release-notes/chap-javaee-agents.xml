 <title>Java EE Policy Agents <?eval ${agentsDocTargetVersion}?></title>

 <para>This chapter concerns OpenAM Java EE policy agents. Java EE policy
 agents run in web application containers and protect Java EE
 applications.</para>

 <important>
  <para>OpenAM Java EE Policy Agents <?eval ${agentsDocTargetVersion}?> Xpress
  is a milestone release from the main development branch of the product. The
  Xpress release contains selected key features and all current fixed issues.
  An Xpress release undergoes important functional testing but not the complete
  testing cycle that is done for a full Enterprise release.</para>

  <para>Xpress releases are supported through ForgeRock subscriptions and are
  upgradeable to the Enterprise version, which has long term support.</para>

  <para>The goal of an Xpress release is to enable you to start build phases
  earlier, with the most recent features, instead of having to wait for the
  Enterprise release date. Fixes to issues that are discovered in an Xpress
  release are delivered as patches to ForgeRock customers, and are guaranteed
  to be delivered in the Enterprise release that follows. Xpress releases are
  supported for a grace period after the Enterprise version has been
  released.</para>

  <para>With the exception of these Release Notes, the official documentation
  for this release is still in progress, and is accessible at
  <link xlink:href="http://openam.forgerock.org/docs.html" xlink:show="new"
  >http://openam.forgerock.org/docs.html</link>. The complete, validated
  documentation set will be available with the Enterprise release.</para>
