%% 1. Build requirements

The OpenSSO workspace uses Apache Ant as the build tool. The build scripts
in this workspace use features not present in releases of Ant prior to 1.6.
Thus, in order to build this workspace you must have Ant version 1.6.5 or above
installed and available in your system path.

The sources in this workspace should be compiled using JDK 6.0. In order to allow
this, you must ensure that JDK 6.0 is present in your system path and the
JAVA_HOME environment variable is setup correctly pointing to its location. The
target JDK is set to 1.5.

Please see this URL for the latest instructions on how to compile OpenSSO:
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/Build+OpenAM+from+Source
The above URL provides a convenient ZIP file of all the needed dependencies below.

%% 2. Library dependencies

The OpenSSO sources depend upon a few third-party libraries that are not
included as a part of the workspace and must be obtained directly from 
the library vendor or distributor. Some of these libraries are available in 
source distribution form and must be built locally before they can be used. 
The libraries needed for compiling OpenSSO sources are:

   - Java EE 5 SDK: j2ee.jar, mail.jar
   - SUN shared library jars: jaxb-api.jar, jaxb-impl.jar, 
     jaxb-libs.jar, jaxb-xjc.jar, jaxrpc-impl.jar, jaxrpc-spi.jar, 
     jaxrpc-api.jar, saaj-api.jar, saaj-impl.jar,
     relaxngDatatype.jar, xmlsec.jar, xalan.jar, xsdlib.jar, 
     FastInfoset.jar, jsr173_api.jar, webservices-api.jar,
     webservices-rt.jar, webservices-tools.jar, webservices-extra.jar,
     webservices-extra-api.jar, OpenDJ.jar, je.jar,
     xercesImpl.jar, jss4.jar
   - TestNG version 5.9 : testng-5.9-jdk15.jar
   - Secure Attribute Exchange API: fmsae.dll and fmsae64.dll
   - Open Message Queue: mq4_4-v2-AIX.zip,mq4_4-v2-Linux_X86.zip, 
                         mq4_4-v2-SunOS_X86.zip,mq4_4-v2-SunOS.zip,
                         mq4_4-v2-WINNT.zip,imq.jar and jms.jar
   - Apache Commons Codec: commons-codec-1.4.jar
   - OpenDS 2.3.x distribution ZIP file

Once these libraries are available, they should be placed under the 
"opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace. Any library placed 
in this directory is automatically included in the classpath during the 
compilation phase of the build process.

The following subsections briefly describe how these libraries may be 
obtained. (Please note as mentioned earlier all needed libraries are available
in a single download by visiting this page:
https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/Build+OpenAM+from+Source).
These instructions are provided for your convenience only and
are not intended to replace or invalidate the procedures/guidelines set
by the library vendor or distributor for obtaining those libraries. Before
you follow these instructions, you must agree to abide by any terms and
conditions set forth by the library vendor or distributor. In case any of
these instructions are in contradiction to such terms or conditions, you 
must disregard those instructions and instead follow the ones provided by
the library vendor or distributor in accordance with their terms and 
conditions.

%% 2.1 Obtaining j2ee.jar and mail.jar

2.1.3 Extract or extract and install the downloaded file as necessary to
      have the SDK available on your system.

Once the J2EE SDK is installed, you can get the javaee.jar and mail.jar from 
the lib directory of this SDK. You must rename javaee.jar to j2ee.jar when 
copying it to the "opensso/products/extlib" directory of your workspace.

%% 3. Building the workspace

The workspace build system offers many build targets. You can view the
available targets by issuing the ant command from the root of the
workspace. The default target that is executed is the usage target which
displays a brief description about the other targets. Currently the main
targets available in the workspace are:
   
     - clean          : deletes the generated files
     - cvsdiff        : generates diffs under diffs subdirectory
     - nightly        : performs nightly builds for all products
     - server-war     : builds the OpenAM WAR file
     - server-tools   : builds the OpenAM admin tools
     - server-nightly : performs nightly builds for server products
     - agents-nightly : performs nightly builds for agents products
     - usage          : displays this usage message

%% 3.1 clean target

Removes build output directories and generated files.

%% 3.2 cvsdiff target

Generates diffs using the cvs command, which are suitable for creating a patch.
Note that OpenAM uses Subversion, not CVS, for the source repository.

%% 3.3 nightly target

Runs server-nightly and agents-nightly targets.

%% 3.4 server-war target

Builds OpenAM, leaving the war files in amserver/built/dist/.

%% 3.5 server-tools target

Builds the OpenAM tools, leaving the zip files in amserver/built/dist/.

%% 3.6 server-nightly target

Builds and packages servers, tools, docs, and samples in built/dist/.

%% 3.7 agents-nightly target

Builds and packages Java EE policy agents in built/dist/.

%% 3.8 usage target

Displays the list of targets.
