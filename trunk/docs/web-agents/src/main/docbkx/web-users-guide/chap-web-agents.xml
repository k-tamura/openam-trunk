 <!-- The following two paras are used in the admin guide, j2ee pa users and web pa users guides -->
 <para> You install policy agents in web servers and web application containers
  to enforce access policies OpenAM applies to protected web sites and web
  applications. Policy agents depend on OpenAM for all authentication and
  authorization decisions. Their primary responsibility consists in enforcing
  what OpenAM decides in a way that is unobtrusive to the user. In organizations
  with many servers, you might well install many policy agents.</para>

 <para>Policy agents can have local configurations where they are installed,
  but usually you store all policy agent configuration information in the
  OpenAM configuration store, defining policy agent profiles for each, and then
  you let the policy agents access their profiles through OpenAM such that you
  manage all agent configuration changes centrally. This chapter describes how
  to set up policy agent profiles in OpenAM for centralized configuration.</para>
