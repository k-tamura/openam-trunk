 <title>Tuning Apache Multi-Processing Modules</title>

 <para>
  Apache 2.0 and later comes with Multi-Processing Modules (MPMs) that extend
  the basic functionality of a web server to support the wide variety of operating
  systems and customizations for a particular site.
 </para>
 <para>
  The key area of performance tuning for Apache is
  to run in worker mode ensuring that they are enough processes and threads
  available to service the expected number of client requests. Apache performance
  is configured in the <filename>conf/extra/http-mpm.conf</filename> file.</para>

 <para>
  The key properties in this file are <literal>ThreadsPerChild</literal> and
  <literal>MaxClients</literal>.
  Together the properties control the maximum number of concurrent requests that can
  be processed by Apache. The default configuration allows for 150 concurrent
  clients spread across 6 processes of 25 threads each.</para>

 <screen>
&lt;IfModule mpm_worker_module>
   StartServers          2
   MaxClients          150
   MinSpareThreads      25
   MaxSpareThreads      75
   ThreadsPerChild      25
   MaxRequestsPerChild   0
&lt;/IfModule>
 </screen>

 <important>
  <para>
   For the policy agent notification feature, the <literal>MaxSpareThreads</literal>,
   <literal>ThreadLimit</literal> and <literal>ThreadsPerChild</literal> default values
   must <emphasis>not</emphasis> be altered; otherwise
   the notification queue listener thread cannot be registered.
  </para>
  <para>
   Any other values apart from these three in the worker MPM can be customized.
   For example, it is possible to use a combination of <literal>MaxClients</literal>
   and <literal>ServerLimit</literal> to achieve a high level of concurrent clients.
