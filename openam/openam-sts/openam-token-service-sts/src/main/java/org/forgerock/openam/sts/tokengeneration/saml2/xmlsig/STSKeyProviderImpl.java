        It is not clear whether Merlin could support a hardware security module, nor the correct way of doing so. It is
        also not clear the customer demand for having STS crypto context stored in a HSM.
        It may well be that common HSMs are consumed via the KeyStore interface, and thus could integrate into Merlin
        transparently - i.e. the merlin.keystore.file could be the KeyStore pseudo-file providing access to HSM. It is
        also possible that this is not the case, and that a good way to support HSM would be to
        allow customers to specify the value corresponding to the org.apache.ws.security.crypto.provider, so that the
        CryptoFactory would instantiate the custom Crypto interface providing HSM access.

         If HSM support is required, and HSMs don't expose a KeyStore interface, then it is possible that a custom
         Crypto interface implementation may be the answer.
