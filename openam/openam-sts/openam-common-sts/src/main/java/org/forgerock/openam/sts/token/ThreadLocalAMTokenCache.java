/**
 * This interface defines the contract that allows token validators (either SecurityPolicy- or STS-related) to persist
 * the OpenSSO session id resulting from a successful token verification. This session id will be the input for all
 * token transformation operations. The bottom line is that state has to be communicated from token validators
 * to token issuers (in the case of the STS validate token transformation actions), within the STS token validation
 * framework. Storing and clearing this state in a ThreadLocal is one approach - another might be to store this token
 * state in a actual STS token store. Because the STS token store is bound by guice, it might make sense to leverage this first -
 * relieves me of the headache of always clearing the thread-local, and worries about propagating ThreadLocal state
 * to newly created threads. But the problem with the TokenStore is that tokens can only be looked-up by key - and the
 * key itself is the session id, so the question is how to communicate this identifier other than via a ThreadLocal, or
 * a defined attribute in the ServletRequest? The two viable approaches are storing the session_id in a ThreadLocal, or
 * in the ServletRequest, as implemented in the AMTokenCacheImpl. See comments in the AMTokenCacheImpl for reasons why the
 * ThreadLocal approach is currently in favor.
