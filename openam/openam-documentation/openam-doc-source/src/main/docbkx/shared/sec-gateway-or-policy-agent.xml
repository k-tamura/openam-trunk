 <title>Open Identity Gateway or Policy Agent?</title>
 <indexterm><primary>Open Identity Gateway</primary></indexterm>
 <para>OpenAM includes both the
  <link xlink:show="new"
        xlink:href="http://openig.forgerock.org/">Open Identity
  Gateway (OpenIG)</link> and also a variety of policy agents.
  Both OpenIG
  and also the policy agents enforce policy, redirecting users to authenticate
  when necessary, and controlling access to protected resources. Yet, the
  Identity Gateway runs as a self-contained reverse proxy located between the
  users and the protected applications. Policy agents are installed into the
  servers where applications run, intercepting requests in that context.</para>

 <para>The OpenIG allows you to protect access to applications not
  suited for a policy agent. Not all web servers and Java EE applications have
  policy agents. Not all operating systems work with policy agents.</para>

 <para>Policy agents have the advantage, where you can install them,
  of sitting within your existing server infrastructure. Once you have
  agents installed into the servers with web applications or sites to protect,
  then you can manage their configurations centrally from OpenAM.</para>

 <para>Of course, for organizations with both servers where you can install
  policy agents and also applications that you must protect without touching
  the server, you can use policy agents on the former and the OpenIG
  for the latter.</para>
