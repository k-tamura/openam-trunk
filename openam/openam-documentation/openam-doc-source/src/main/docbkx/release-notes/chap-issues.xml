  <title>Limitations</title>

  <!-- For OPENAM-1919 TODO: Remove when this is fixed after 10.1.0-Xpress -->
  <para>Creating a user by sending an HTTP POST of the JSON representation of
  the user to <literal>/json/users/?_action=create</literal> is not supported
  in this Xpress release.</para>

  <!-- For OPENAM-1920 TODO: Remove when this is fixed after 10.1.0-Xpress -->
  <para>Deleting a user by sending an HTTP DELETE to
  <literal>/json/users/<replaceable>user-id</replaceable></literal> is not
  supported in this Xpress release.</para>

  <!-- For OPENAM-1906 TODO: Remove when this is fixed after 10.1.0-Xpress -->
  <para>If you create a new realm, you must restart OpenAM before using the
  new identity management REST API to manage identities under the new realm.
  When you try to access users in the new realm before restarting OpenAM,
  OpenAM returns HTTP 404 Not found errors, even for users who exist.</para>

  <!-- For OPENAM-1886 TODO: Remove when this is fixed after 10.1.0-Xpress -->
  <para>When session failover is configured to use external OpenDJ directory
  servers, OpenAM must access those directory servers through an LDAP load
  balancer that can fail over connections from OpenAM whenever a directory
  server goes offline. Otherwise, sessions could continue to persist after
  users logout of OpenAM.</para>

  <para>Do not run different versions of OpenAM together in the same OpenAM
  site.</para>

  <para>Not all features of OpenAM work with IPv6.</para>

  <para>The Database Repository type of data store is experimental and not
  supported for production use.</para>

  <!-- Fix for OPENAM-1032: Add details to the release notes and documentation of OpenAM (for 875) -->
  <para>By default OpenAM does not enforce session quotas when running in Site
  mode without session failover. To work around this behavior, set the server
  configuration property
  <literal>openam.session.useLocalSessionsInMultiServerMode=true</literal>.
  You can set this property in OpenAM console under Configuration &gt; Servers
  and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; Server Name &gt; Advanced.</para>
