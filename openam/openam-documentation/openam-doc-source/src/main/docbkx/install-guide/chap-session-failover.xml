 <title>Setting Up OpenAM Session Failover</title>
 <indexterm>
  <primary>Installing</primary>
  <secondary>Session failover</secondary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>
  This chapter covers setting up session failover (SFO).
  Session failover allows another OpenAM server to manage a session
  when the server that initially authenticated the user is down.
  This means the user does not need to log in again,
  even though the server that authenticated them is down.
 </para>

 <para>
  Session failover (high availability for sessions) builds
  on OpenAM service availability.
  Before configuring session failover,
  you must therefore first make the overall OpenAM service highly available.
  This is done by setting up OpenAM in a site configuration.
  You can find instructions for setting up a site configuration in the chapter,
  <link

   xlink:href="install-guide#chap-install-multiple"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
  ><citetitle>Installing Multiple Servers</citetitle></link>.
 </para>
 
 <para>
  Session failover also relies on a shared Core Token Service (CTS)
  to store user session data.
  The service is shared with other OpenAM servers in the same OpenAM Site.
  When an OpenAM server goes down, other servers in the Site
  can read user session information from the CTS,
  so the user with a valid session does not have to log in again.
  When the original OpenAM server becomes available again,
  it can also read session information from the CTS,
  and can carry on serving users with active sessions.
  By default the Core Token Service uses the embedded OpenDJ directory server.
  For more information on configuring the Core Token Service, see the chapter,
  <link

  ><citetitle>Configuring the Core Token Service (CTS)</citetitle></link>.
 </para>

 <para>
  In deployments with multiple OpenAM Sites,
  session failover can function across Sites.
  In order for this to work, all Sites must use
  the same, global, underlying Core Token Service,
  which is replicated across all Sites.
  Then when an entire Site fails or becomes unavailable,
  OpenAM servers in another Site detect the failure of the Site's load balancer
  and attempt to recover the user session from the global Core Token Service.
 </para>

 <para>
  In the event of a failure,
  client applications can connect to an OpenAM server in an active data center
  as shown in <xref linkend="figure-global-cts" />.

  <title>To Configure Session Failover After Installation</title>
  
  <para>
   Session failover requires an OpenAM Site configuration
   with a Core Token Service.
  </para>

  <para>
   If you did not configure session persistence and availability during
   initial configuration,
   first complete the steps in the procedure,
   <link
    xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="install-guide#configure-site-load-balancing"
    xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   ><citetitle>To Configure Site Load Balancing</citetitle></link>,
   and then follow these steps.
  </para>

  <step>
   <para>
    In the OpenAM console for one of the servers in the Site,
    under Configuration > Global, click Session.
   </para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>
    Under Secondary Configuration Instance, click New.
   </para>

   <para>
    If the server is not part of a Site,
    or if the configuration server does not support the Core Token Service,
    the New button is grayed out.
   </para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>
    In the Add Sub Configuration page,
    check that the Name is set to the name of the site.
   </para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>
    To activate the Session Persistence and High Availability Failover option,
    click the Enabled box.
   </para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>To enable crosstalk between OpenAM instances, click the Enabled box. This
    ensures that OpenAM instances talk with each other to resolve any non-local
    sessions, rather than using session persistence.</para>

   <para>Note that if you have a large numbers of requests (for example, millions
    of requests per hour), the crosstalk could adversely affect server performance
    with the increase in network traffic.</para>

   <para>If session persistence is enabled, the crosstalk option is not enabled by default.
    If session persistence is <emphasis>not</emphasis> enabled, crosstalk is
    automatically enabled by default. If both session persistence and crosstalk is enabled,
    both features will be implemented, which could result in more network traffic.
