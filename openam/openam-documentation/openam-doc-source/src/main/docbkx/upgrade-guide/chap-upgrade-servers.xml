 <title>Upgrading OpenAM Servers</title>

 <para>This chapter covers upgrade from OpenAM core server 9.5 or later to the
 current version. For other OpenAM components, see <link xlink:show="new"
 xlink:href="admin-guide#chap-backup-restore"
 xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"><citetitle>Upgrading OpenAM
 Components</citetitle></link>.</para>

 <para>OpenAM server upgrade relies on the Upgrade Wizard to make the
 necessary changes to the configuration store. You must then restart OpenAM or
 the container in which it runs. Even a version number change requires that you
 run the Upgrade Wizard, so needing to run the Upgrade Wizard says nothing about
 the significance of the changes that have been made to OpenAM. You must run
 the Upgrade Wizard even for maintenance releases.</para>

 <para>Make sure you try upgrading OpenAM in a test environment before applying
 the upgrade in your production environment.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="upgrade-server">
  <title>To Upgrade From OpenAM 9.5 or Later</title>

  <para>Follow these steps to upgrade a site of OpenAM servers (version 9.5 or
  later). During the upgrade process, you must take the OpenAM servers in the
  site out of production, instead redirecting client application traffic
  elsewhere. This is required because upgrade involves making changes to
  OpenAM's configuration model. If the upgrade fails, you must be able to
  roll back before the configuration changes impact other sites.</para>

  <important>
   <para>
    Do <emphasis>not</emphasis> perform an upgrade
    by deploying the new version
    and then importing an existing configuration
    by running the <command>ssoadm import-svc-config</command> command.
    Importing an outdated configuration can result in a corrupted installation.
   </para>
  </important>

  <step>
   <para>Prepare your customized OpenAM server .war file.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Back up the deployment.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>Route client application traffic to another site during the upgrade.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, stop OpenAM, or if necessary stop the
   container where OpenAM runs.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, deploy your customized server .war file.</para>

   <para>When you deploy the new .war file, you might have to delete working
   files left by the old installation. For example, if you deploy on Apache
   Tomcat, replacing <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam.war</filename>,
   then also recursively delete the
   <filename>/path/to/tomcat/webapps/openam/</filename>
   and <filename>/path/to/tomcat/work/Catalina/localhost/openam/</filename>
   directories before restarting the server.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For servers in the site, restart OpenAM or the container where it runs.</para>
  </step>

  <step>
   <para>For the first server in the site, follow the instructions in the
   Upgrade Wizard.</para>

   <para>
    Alternatively for a silent, unattended upgrade,
    you can use the <filename>${ssoconfigUpgradeJarFile}</filename> tool
    to upgrade the server configuration in a command-line script.
   </para>

   <para>
    First you must install the tool.
    The procedure,

     xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
    ><citetitle>To Set Up Configuration Tools</citetitle></link>,
    describes how to install the tool.
   </para>

   <para>
    The upgraded server must be deployed and running when you use the tool.
   </para>

   <para>
    The ${ssoconfigUpgradeJarFile} relies on a properties file
    to upgrade OpenAM server.
   </para>

DEPLOYMENT_URI=/openam
ACCEPT_LICENSES=true</computeroutput>
   </screen>

   <para>
    When the new OpenAM server .war file is deployed and running,
    you can upgrade by using the tool with the properties file.

  <title>To Complete Upgrade from OpenAM 10.1.0 Xpress</title>

   <para>When upgrading from OpenAM 10.1.0 Xpress, the upgrade tool does not
   change the Dashboard service LDAP schema, although the object IDs used in
   the Dashboard service LDAP schema definitions are not correct.</para>

   <para>You can fix the object IDs manually using the OpenDJ
   <command>ldapmodify</command> command. The command is delivered with OpenDJ
   directory server.</para>

   <para>Update the LDAP schema defined in the OpenDJ directory server where
   OpenAM stores its configuration.</para>

   <para>Make the change on one of the replicated OpenDJ configuration
   directory servers.</para>

   command delivered with the embedded OpenDJ configuration directory server
   for OpenAM with deployment URI <literal>/openam</literal>. When you use the
