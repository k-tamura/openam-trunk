/**
 * Core Token Service Persistent Store is responsible for the storage and retrieval of Tokens
 * from a persistent store.
 *
 * The Core Token Service is exposed through a series of CRUDL operations which require the
 * use of TokenAdapters to convert from objects to be stored into the expected Core Token
 * Service format. This allows the Tokens to be stored in a generic storage.
 *
 * The current main use cases for the CTS are:
 *
 * - Session fail-over
 * - OAuth token storage
 * - SAML Federation token storage
 * - Forgotten Password
 *
 * The implementation of this interface must be thread safe as this service will often
 * be on a direct call path from the front end of the Server hosting OpenAM, and so
 * multiple calls to the service can occur at the same time from different calling threads.
 *
 * @see org.forgerock.openam.cts.adapters.TokenAdapter
