/**
 * This implementation makes use of simple tree node references to help improve tree navigation performance and to keep
 * the memory footprint to a minimal. It does this by using tree nodes that contain basic references to its position in
 * the tree as opposed to using {@link List} for instance.
 * 
 * It makes use of a factory for the node creation so that the behavior of resource evaluation can be adapted.
 *
 * A search against the tree makes a single traversal down the tree and across the passed resource string. Each
 * character of the passed resource is evaluated against nodes at the corresponding position within the tree. A
 * node that has interest in the current resource character elects itself as a candidate. Each subsequent character of
 * the resource is evaluated against the elected candidates and their child nodes. Once the tree and resource is fully
 * traversed a collection of elected tree nodes would have been populated, where these nodes have an exact match against
 * the resource or by part match by use of wildcards. The tree path of these nodes represents an index rule and if such
 * a node is an end point, represents an index rule initially added to the tree.
