 <para>
  The current implementation of the WSSAuth Authentication module, along with
  the Web Service Provider, Web Service Client and STS Client Policy agents,
  were developed for versions 1.0 and 1.3 of the WS-Trust standard. ForgeRock
  now includes configuration options for the RESTful Security Token Service
  (STS), compatible with version 1.4 of the WS-Trust standard, which uses
  client certificate and Kerberos JASPI authentication modules.
