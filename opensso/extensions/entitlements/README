Ant 1.7.0+ is required.

Need these binaries in extlib directory

1. opensso.war - for unwar to include entitlements.jar and resources
2. ssoAdminTools.zip - for unzip to include entitlements related CLI
3. testng-5.9-jdk15.jar - for unittest

The first time the workspace is built, you must be on SWAN and have access to
/net/policy. The directories .../war-lib and .../build-lib will be populated.
After this, /net/policy connectivity is not required.
