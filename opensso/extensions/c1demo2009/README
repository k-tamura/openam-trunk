This README describes how to run the 2009 CommunityOne/JavaOne RESTful Secure 
Web Services Demo.

NOTE - this is a fairly intricate setup, and not recommended for the novice 
user. There are also almost certainly many errors in this first version of the
instructions!

%% 1. Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed and running to be able to run 
the demo:

MySQL - I used 5.1.33, but I don't think the exact version is critical

JDK 6 - http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

NetBeans IDE 6.5.1 for JavaFX 1.2 - http://java.sun.com/javafx/downloads/ - you
can use NetBeans 6.5.0 as long as you have the JavaFX plugins installed (see 
below).

GlassFish v2 UR2 - https://glassfish.dev.java.net/downloads/v2ur2-b04.html

Maven - I used 2.0.6, but, again, I don't think the exact version is critical

The demo assumes that GlassFish is in its default configuration, with an HTTP 
listener on port 8080.

You will need to install the following plugins for NetBeans, if they are not 
already installed:

GlassFish v1, v2 version 1.6.2.1 (earlier versions may also work)
JavaFX SDK for Mac OS X version 1.7
JavaFX Kit version 1.8
RESTful Web Services version 1.0.3
Maven version 4.05

You will also need to configure demo.example.com as a local DNS alias for 
127.0.0.1 - you'll need to add demo.example.com to the end of the 127.0.0.1 
line in /etc/hosts, or the corresponding hosts file for your version of 
Windows:

Windows 2000  - C:windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  Windows XP    - C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  Windows NT    - C:\winnt\system32\drivers\etc\hosts  Windows Vista – C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts

You should end up with a line in the hosts file of the form:

127.0.0.1       localhost demo.example.com

%% 2. Checking Out the Demo Source Code

Checkout the demo source code from OpenSSO's CVS repository. See 
https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/faqcenter/faqgetstart.html#checkout
for instructions. The demo source code is located in 
<source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009

NOTE - if you are checking the code out from CVS for the first time in 
NetBeans, ensure that you leave the 'branch' empty - this will result in the 
'trunk' being checked out from CVS.

%% 3. Creating the Demo Database

The scripts to create a demo database, demo users and create and populate the 
demo tables are located in 
<source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoServer/src/conf/
and can be run via:

$ cd <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoServer/src/conf/
$ mysql -uroot -p<password> < create_database.mysql
$ mysql -uroot -p<password> -Dj1demodb < create_dbusers.sql
$ mysql -uroot -p<password> -Dj1demodb < setup.sql

If you ever need to recreate the database from scratch, you can drop it by 
running:

$ mysql -uroot -p<password> < drop_database.mysql

%% 4. Deploying the Demo Web Service

Start NetBeans and open the Demo Web Service project at 
<source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoServer. 

You may need to create a data connection for j1demodb. Select the C1DemoServer 
project, right click, select 'Resolve Data Sources', select 'Add Connection'.

Enter the Name:  MySQL (Connector / J driver)
Enter the host:  localhost
Port:  3306
Database:  j1demodb
User Name:  j1demouser
Password:  j1demouser
select: Remember password

In the 'Projects' pane, expand C1DemoServer, expand 'Configuration Files', 
right-click C1DemoServer.dbschema and select 'Recapture Schema from Database'.
  
To test the demo web service, we will need to disable security: in NetBeans' 
'Projects' pane, open the C1DemoServer project (click the triangle to the left 
of the project name) and open 'Configuration Files'. Double click 'web.xml', 
select 'XML' to see edit the contents of the file and comment out or remove the 
two <filter> elements and the two <filter-mapping> elements - everything from 
the end of the <web-app> opening tag to the start of the <servlet> opening tag. 
It's OK to just delete the elements, since you can easily revert to the 
original web.xml file later.

Now right-click the C1DemoServer project in the 'Projects' pane, select 
'Properties', go to the 'Run' category, and check that the GlassFish v2 UR2 
server is selected.

You can now deploy C1DemoServer - just right-click C1DemoServer in the 
'Projects' pane and select 'Deploy'. Once the project is deployed, you can test
the demo web service from a browser. Right-click C1DemoServer in the 'Projects' 
pane, select 'Run', then visit the following URLs in your browser:

http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/ should give a list of 
phone elements

http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/ should give a 
single phone element

http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/ should give a list of 
accounts

http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345 should 
give a single account

Alternately, select Project right click, select 'Test RESTful web services'. 
This will bring up an HTML page with a test interface to test the RESTful 
interface. Note: this does not currently work in Safari.

%% 5. Deploying and Configuring OpenSSO with Entitlements

At present, OpenSSO's fine-grained authorization functionality, also known as
'Entitlements' is being developed as an OpenSSO extension. Unfortunately, it is
not possible to build the WAR file for OpenSSO with Entitlements unless you are
on the Sun internal network. For this reason, I have uploaded the WAR file to
mediacast.sun.com. You can download it from

http://mediacast.sun.com/users/metadaddy/media/entitlement.war

Deploy the WAR file by copying it into GlassFish's autodeploy directory - 
<glassfish directory>/domains/domain1/autodeploy/. It will likely take a minute
or two to deploy; once deployment is complete, a file named 
entitlement.war_deployed will be created in the autodeploy directory.

Now we will need to configure OpenSSO. In your browser, go to 
http://demo.example.com:8080/entitlement/ and you should see the OpenSSO 
configurator. IMPORTANT - do NOT use localhost when deploying OpenSSO - OpenSSO
needs a fully-qualified domain name to function correctly.

Select the default configuration and supply the admin passwords. IMPORTANT -
ensure you record or remember the admin passwords - if you forget them you will
need to redeploy OpenSSO.

Once OpenSSO has been configured, we need to create a JDBC data store. Follow
the link to the OpenSSO login page and log in as amadmin with the password you
supplied at configuration. Now click 'Access Control', then the top level realm
listed under 'Realms'. Click 'Data Stores', then the 'New' button.

Give the new Data Store name: 'JDBC', select 'Database Repository' as the type 
and click 'Next'. You will need to enter the following data:

	Password for Connecting to Database: <your password> (j1demouser)
	
	JDBC Driver URL: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/j1demodb
	
	Connect This User to Database: j1demouser
	
	Database User Table Name: phone
	
	List of User Attributes Names in Database: Delete all of the existing entries 
	and add the following:
	
	user_name
	allocated_minutes
	phone_number
	account_number
	can_download_music
	inetuserstatus
	can_download_ringtones
	can_download_video
	password
	head_of_household
	
	User Password Attribute Name: password
	
	User ID Attribute Name: phone_number
	
	Attribute Name of User Status: inetuserstatus
	
	Users Search Attribute in Database: phone_number
	
	Database Membership table name: account
	
	Membership ID Attribute Name: account_number
	
	Membership Search Attribute in Database: account_number

Leave the remaining fields as-is, and click 'Save'. You should see the 'JDBC' 
data store listed under the embedded store. Now click the 'Subjects' tab and 
you should see a number of users in the store, identified by phone numbers.

Note that the grouping functionality in the JDBC data store is not yet 
functional, so you won't see an account listed in the 'Groups' tab. This isn't 
a problem - we don't need it for the demo.

Now we need to create policies for OpenSSO to protect our web service. The demo
policies use custom condition classes, which are not supported by the current 
version of the entitlements admin user interface, so we'll need to create them
programmatically. Copy the two JSP files, javaoneDemo.jsp and 
javaoneDemoEval.jsp from <source location>/opensso/extensions/entitlements/demo 
to <glassfish directory>/domains/domain1/applications/j2ee-modules/entitlement/,
then go to http://demo.example.com:8080/entitlement/javaoneDemo.jsp - this JSP
will create the demo policies. You can now test the policies by going to
http://demo.example.com:8080/entitlement/javaoneDemoEval.jsp - if all is well,
you will see this:

Subject  Action	Resource                                                                          Allow/Deny
1234567890 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890                     allowed
1234567890 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/?param=value        allowed

1234567890 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333                     allowed
1234567890 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333/?param=value        allowed
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890                     denied
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/?param=value        denied
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333                     allowed
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333/?param=value        allowed
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890                     denied
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/?param=value        denied
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333                     denied
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333/?param=value        denied
1234567890 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345              allowed
1234567890 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345/?param=value allowed
1234567890 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345              allowed
1234567890 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345/?param=value allowed
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345              denied
1112223333 GET  http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345/?param=value denied
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345              denied
1112223333 POST http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/accounts/123456789012345/?param=value denied

This shows that:

1. Both users are able to GET their own phone records
2. The user 1234567980 (which has the 'head_of_household' flag set) can GET and
POST both his own and 1112223333's phone records
3. The user 1234567980 is also able to GET and POST to the 123456789012345 
account

All other access is denied - 1112223333 can't POST to his own phone, or access 
1234567890's phone or the account.

You can also test OpenSSO's entitlement web service:

http://localhost:8080/entitlement/ws/1/entitlement/decision?realm=/&subject=id=1112223333,ou=user,dc=opensso,dc=java,dc=net&action=GET&resource=http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333

returns 'allow' - 1112223333 can GET his own phone,. while

http://localhost:8080/entitlement/ws/1/entitlement/decision?realm=/&subject=id=1112223333,ou=user,dc=opensso,dc=java,dc=net&action=GET&resource=http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890

returns 'deny' - 1234567890 is not allowed to GET 1234567890. You can 
experiment by changing the subject and resource in the URL to check that the 
policies are correctly evaluated.

NOTE - there is currently a bug in the entitlements code which may result in a 
null pointer exception when evaluating policy. To avoid this bug, you MUST 
invoke http://demo.example.com:8080/entitlement/javaoneDemoEval.jsp after each 
GlassFish restart. If you forget to invoke javaoneDemoEval.jsp and encounter 
the null pointer exception, you must restart GlassFish and then invoke 
javaoneDemoEval.jsp.

%% 6. Deploying the OAuth Token Service

Currently, the OAuth Token Service uses the Java DB ('Derby'), and requires 
several steps of configuration before it is ready to run.

First, you must ensure that the DERBY_HOME environment variable is correctly 
set - on a *nix machine, you'll need to do the following:

export DERBY_HOME=<glassfish directory>/javadb

I set this in my ~/.bashrc file, which is, in turn, sourced by my 
~/.bash_profile.

Now, restart Glassfish and Derby:

<glassfish directory>/bin/asadmin stop-domain
<glassfish directory>/bin/asadmin start-database
<glassfish directory>/bin/asadmin start-domain

Create the OAuth Token Service tables using the Derby 'ij' utility. Before 
running 'ij' for the first time, you may need to set its executable flag:

sudo chmod a+x <glassfish directory>/javadb/bin/ij

$ <glassfish directory>/javadb/bin/ij
ij version 10.2
ij> connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/TokenServiceDB;create=true;user=username;password=password';
ij> run '<source location>/opensso/extensions/oauth/oauth-service/etc/dbsetup.sql';
ij> quit;

NOTE - since the dbsetup.sql script starts by dropping the reqtoken, acctoken 
and consumer tables, it will show an error message the first time you run it. 
This is expected.

Next, we need to create a JDBC connection pool and resource. Go to 
http://localhost:4848/ and login as admin with the password adminadmin. Open 
the 'Resources' entry in the list on the left, then 'JDBC', and click 
'Connection Pools' then the 'New' button.

You'll need to change the following fields:

Name: TokenServicePool
Resource Type: javax.sql.DataSource
Database Vendor: Derby

(click 'Next', then Additional Properties)

DatabaseName: TokenServiceDB
Password: password
User: username

Click 'Finish'.

Now, Click 'JDBC Resources' in the left hand pane, then 'New' on the right.

JNDI Name: TokenServiceDB
Pool Name: TokenServicePool

(click 'OK').

Now we can build and deploy the OAuth Token Service. NOTE - you must have 
ensure that you are using JDK 1.6. On a Mac, you can use the 'Java Preferences' 
app in /Applications/Utilities. Just drag 'Java SE 6' to the top of the 'Java 
Applications' list.
 
To build the OAuth Token Service:

cd <source location>/opensso/extensions/oauth/oauth-service
mvn install

Deploy the oauth-service WAR file (target/oauth-service.war) via the GlassFish 
admin console - log in to the GlassFish admin console again and click 'Web 
Applications' in the list on the left, then the 'Deploy' button on the right.

Select 'Local packaged file' and give it the location of the OAuth Token 
Service WAR - <source location>/opensso/extensions/oauth/oauth-service/target/oauth-service.war

IMPORTANT - you MUST change the 'Context Root' from the default 'oauth-service' 
to 'TokenService'. Hit 'OK' to deploy the OAuth Token Service.

You can also deploy from the command line with:

/Applications/NetBeans/glassfish-v2ur2/bin/asadmin deploy --host localhost \
--port 4848 --user admin --contextroot /TokenService --precompilejsp=false \
--verify=false --name "oauth-service" --enabled=true \
<source location>/opensso/extensions/oauth/oauth-service/target/oauth-service.war

%% 7. Running the Demo Test Harness

Now we have all of the infrastructure up and running, we can run the Demo Test 
Harness. 

The first thing to do is to re-enable security in C1DemoServer - go to the 
web.xml file and uncomment the two <filter> elements and the two 
<filter-mapping> elements, or just right click web.xml in the projects pane on 
the left and select 'CVS', then 'Revert Modifications'. NetBeans should 
automatically redeploy the project, but you can right-click C1DemoServer on the 
left and click 'Deploy' to be sure.

Once C1DemoServer has been redeployed, any attempt to access it from the 
browser will result in a 401 error. You can try this by going to 
http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/. If you go to
'Page Info' in the browser and look at the HTTP headers, you'll see that the
WWW-Authenticate header is set to 'OAuth realm="http://www.example.com/"', 
showing that OAuth is required.

Now, open the Netbeans project 
<source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoHarness and built it. 
The demo harness takes a username, password and a list of URLs. It will attempt 
to obtain an OAuth token using the username and password, then GET each URL in 
turn.

Run the test harness from the command line:

java -jar <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoHarness/dist/C1DemoHarness.jar 1112223333 abc123 http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1112223333/

You should see output similar to

	Registering the OAuth consumer
	
	{consumer_key=[http://localhost:8080/TokenService/resources/oauth/v1/consumer/javafx], consumer_secret=[javafx_secret]}
	
	Getting an OAuth request token

	    </notificationCollection>
	    <phoneNumber>1112223333</phoneNumber>
	    <userName>Billy Spencer</userName>
	</phone>

User 1112223333 ('Billy') can GET his own phone. We can see the result of Billy
trying to GET another phone on the account with

java -jar <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoHarness/dist/C1DemoHarness.jar 1112223333 abc123 http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/123456790/

	GETting resource: http://localhost:8080/C1DemoServer/resources/phones/1234567890/
	
	Server returned 403 Forbidden

Billy can successfully GET his own phone, but is forbidden from GETting any 
others.

Again, you can experiment by changing the username and resource to check that 
policy is being enforced correctly.

NOTE - one user reported a 500 error when running the test harness. The 
GlassFish log indicated that there was an unwanted 'ssl=off' property in 
TokenServicePool's 'Additional Properties' tab. Deleting this property solved 
the issue.

%% 8. Running the Demo Client

Now we're finally ready to run the JavaFX demo client! Open the C1DemoClient 
project and build it. Now run the demo client from the command line. Note that
we pass the phone number in on the command line to simulate the client being 
deployed and configured on a phone.

~/.netbeans/6.5/javafx-sdk/bin/javafx -jar <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoClient/dist/C1DemoClient.jar phoneNumber=1234567890

Log in with password abc123 and you will see a menu with options for Statement, 
Account Settings, Family Settings, Notifications and Logout. You can explore 
the interface, but note that setting the account billing address is not 
implemented. In particular, notice that as 'Frank', a 'head of household' on 
the account, we can see calls for all phones on the account, and even set the 
capabilities of other phones on the account, allowing the kids to download 
ringtones, music and video.

Now run the client as another user (you can leave the first instance running if
you like):

~/.netbeans/6.5/javafx-sdk/bin/javafx -jar <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoClient/dist/C1DemoClient.jar phoneNumber=1112223333

Log in with password abc123, and, notice that the menu is different for 'Billy' 
- he can only see Phone Statement, Phone Settings, Notifications and Logout. 
Also, he can only see his phone settings, he can't change them.

In the 'Frank' instance of the client (phone number 1234567890), you can go to
Family Settings/Billy and check 'Allow Ringtones', then go look in Billy's 
instance to see that the same item is checked.

If you want to change the password for a user, click 'Set/Reset Password' on 
the login page. The first time you do this, it will ask for the last 4 digits
of a credit card and the card verification number - enter 3456 and 1234 
respectively. Now you can set a password reset question and answer, and a 
password. Subsequent password resets will use this question and answer rather
than the credit card details.

Finally, we can show that the web service is secure in the face of accidentally 
or deliberately malicious clients. In the C1DemoClient project, navigate in the
left hand pane to Source Packages/c1democlient/Home.fx and go to line 55. This 
is where the client UI decides whether to show the 'head of household' menu, 
depending on whether it has been able to obtain an Account object. Comment out
this line and uncomment the following line, then build the project.

Close any instances of the demo client, and restart it for Billy, with 

~/.netbeans/6.5/javafx-sdk/bin/javafx -jar <source location>/opensso/extensions/c1demo2009/C1DemoClient/dist/C1DemoClient.jar phoneNumber=1112223333

After logging in, you should see Frank's menu, but any attempt to access the 
list of phones or account information results in an error. You can see the 403 
(forbidden) errors in the terminal window. The service is secure, both against
unauthenticated use and authenticated but unauthorized use.

Now go and pour yourself a beverage of your choice - if you got this far, 
you've earned it!
