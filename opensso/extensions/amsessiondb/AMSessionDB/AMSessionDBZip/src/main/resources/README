1. Overview

amsessiondb is designed as a drop in replacement for the existing OpenAM session
failover system that uses MQ and Berkeley DB.

2. Installation

Copy the following files into your OpenAM webapp WEB-INF/lib directory and
restart the container.

* AMSessionRepository-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
* AMSessionStoreCommon-0.2-SNAPSHOT.jar
* commons-net-2.2.jar                    
* jackson-core-asl-1.4.3.jar             
* jackson-mapper-asl-1.4.3.jar           
* org.osgi.core-4.0.0.jar                
* org.restlet-2.0.15.jar               
* org.restlet.ext.crypto-2.0.15.jar   
* org.restlet.ext.jackson-2.0.15.jar      

3. Configuration

3.1. amsessiondb setup

When extracting the amsessiondb zip file, the bin/setup.sh script must be run. 
Review the file config/amsessiondb.properties before running the setup.sh script. 
This properties file controls the port and suffix used during the installation 
and importantly the password used to protect the amsessiondb store.

3.1.1. Secondary instance setup

Before installing a secondary instance you must edit the amsessiondb.properties file
and update the following property to point to your first instance.

amsessiondb.exising.server.url=http://server1.internal.forgerock.com:8182/amsessiondb

NB: The JAVA_HOME environmental variable must be set correct for the amsessiondb
scripts to operate correctly. 

3.2. OpenAM Configuration 

3.2.1. OpenAM Advanced Property Configuration

To enable the amsessiondb client in OpenAM you must set the following advanced 
property in the console under Configuration > Servers and Sites.

com.sun.identity.ha.famrecordpersister = 
    org.forgerock.openam.amsessionrepository.client.AMSessionDBRecordPersister

NB: Ignore the warning about "Unidentified property"

3.2.2. OpenAM Session Service Configuration

For OpenAM session failover to be configured, OpenAM must be running in a site
configuration. Please site this article to assist in configuring sites:

https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/openam/5+Extending+to+a+Dual+Instance+Deployment

When configuring the session service in OpenAM; the same procedure should be 
followed only with these configuration changes to the secondary session 
configuration instance.

* Session Store User : amsessiondb
* Session Store Password : <password>
* Session Store Password (confirm) : <password>
* Maximum Wait Time : 5000
* Database Url : http://localhost:8182/amsessiondb
* Session Failover Enabled : (True) Enabled

3.3 amsessiondb configuration.

amsessiondb is configured using the configuration files in the config directory:

* amsessiondb.properties : General configuration; port number, URI et cetera
* amsessiondblog.properties : Controls the log level of the components
* dbconfig.xml : Configures the embedded OrientDB server

4. Startup

In the amsessiondb/bin directory, run the start.sh command.

5. Operational

When the amsessiondb server is running, there are two useful URLs:

http://localhost:8182/amsessiondb/stats

This returns the following information in JSON format.

* uptime : The uptime of the server in ms
* numSessions : The number of sessions in the database
* totalRequests : The total number of requests received.
* totalReads : The total number of read requests received.
* totalWrites : The total number of write requests received.
* totalDeletes : The total number of delete requests received.
* totalReadSessionCount : The total number of read session count requests 
  received.

http://localhost:8182/amsessiondb/config

This returns the configuration of the amsessiondb server in JSON format. This is
useful for debugging and support purposes.

6. Troubleshooting

amsessiondb logs its operations to the amsessiondb-0-0.log in the logs 
directory.

To enable debugging change this entry amsessiondb.level in the 
amsessiondblog.properties configuration file to FINEST and restart.
