<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="browse"></a> How do I browse the source code?</b></b></p>

<p>You can browse the source code without a java.net account by going to the <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/source/browse/opensso/">Source - CVS</a> page.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="checkout"></a> How do I checkout the source code?</b></b></p>

<p>To checkout the project source as a registered java.net user, see <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource">https://opensso.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectSource</a>. As a registered user, you will be able to commit changes back to the tree if you have been approved as an OpenSSO <i>Committer</i>. (See the <a href="https://opensso.dev.java.net/public/about/governance/index.html">governance</a> for more details on OpenSSO project roles).
</p>
<p>
You can also checkout the source code with a CVS client as a <i>guest</i>. Use <i>guest</i> as a username and password with the following command:
</p>
<p>
<code>cvs -d :pserver:guest:guest@cvs.dev.java.net:/cvs checkout opensso<code>
</p>
<p>
<i>Note: You cannot commit changes back to CVS as guest!</i>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="built"></a> Now that I've built the code, what can I do?</b></b></p>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="changes"></a> How do I make changes to files in the OpenSSO source?</b></b></p>

<p>An OpenSSO contributor may resolve an issue by applying new code to files in the source tree. This is the process for making changes to files in the OpenSSO source:
<ol>
<li>Check out the latest copy of the source files.</li>
<li>Make modifications to the appropriate files.</li>
<li>Write comments to explain the changes you have made.</li>
<li>Modify the comments that will be generated using the Javadoc<sup>TM</sup> tool and any other appropriate documentation.</li>
<li>Build the software and verify your fix.</li>
<li>Run the relevant sanity and regression tests to make sure that the fix has not broken anything.</li>
</ol>

<tr><td><p><b>Q:<b><a name="patch"></a> What is a patch and how do I submit one?</b></b></p>

<p>Running <pre>cvs diff</pre> reports the differences between two versions of the same file. A <i>patch</i> captures these exact changes. The receiver of a patch applies it to their workspace to merge the changes and bring their version up-to-date with your version. <i>All patches must be reviewed before adding them back to the source tree.</i>

<p>This is the process for submitting a patch file for review:

<ol>
<li>Create a patch file:
<ol type="a">
<li> % cd <i>checkedout_source</i></li>
<li> % cvs diff -u > <i>patch_report_name</i></li>
</ol> 

<p><li>Enter an issue in Issue Tracker that corresponds to the patch, if none exists.</li>
<p><i>Submit only one patch per issue. Do not submit a patch to fix more than one issue unless they are closely related.</i>
<p><li>Submit your patch along with the issue number to <a href="mailto:code-review@opensso.dev.java.net">code-review@opensso.dev.java.net</a>.</li>
<p><li>If approved, attach the patch file to the issue in Issue Tracker. This can be attached as a file or copied directly into the Suggested Fix field.</li>
<p><li>Send the approved patch to <a href="mailto:committers@opensso.dev.java.net">committers@opensso.dev.java.net</a> to have it applied to the source tree.</li>
<p><li>Once the patch is applied, the committer will update the issue in Issue Tracker as fixed.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have found a critical security issue, please follow the <a href="faqbugs.html">guidelines for filing critical security issues</a>. 
<p>If your patch is big or you intend to develop a product enhancement, you must follow the architecture review guidelines before submitting the patch. For more information, send an email to <a href="mailto:code-review@opensso.dev.java.net">code-review@opensso.dev.java.net</a>.
