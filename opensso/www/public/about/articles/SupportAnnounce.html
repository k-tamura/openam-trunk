<h1>OpenSSO Support from Sun Microsystems</h1>

Sun Microsystems is the largest contributor of open source code in the world. With projects such as MySQL, OpenSolaris, Netbeans, Java, Glassfish, OpenESB, OpenSSO and OpenDS, the Sun-led open source community is growing at a massive pace. Because project community members are now leveraging the latest open source code to develop new features before Sun has released its latest commercial offerings, customers are finding that they need longer term support contracts. In response to this demand from both Sun Java System Access Manager customers and OpenSSO community members, Sun is now providing comprehensive support for OpenSSO. 

OpenSSO is the largest open source identity project for fully featured access control, federation management and web services security capabilities in a single Java distribution. (Sun Java System Access Manager was the commercial release from which Sun Microsystems took the code which became the foundation of the OpenSSO project.) Customers who need access to a simple single sign-on (SSO) solution with extranet scaling can now purchase a perpetual license for Sun Java System Access Manager, or a subscription to the Sun Identity Management Suite or Java Enterprise System and receive OpenSSO support at no additional cost.

And this new support model is simple. Current Sun customers do not have to do anything to take advantage of it. Existing contracts will be expanded to include support for OpenSSO. And new customers don't have to weigh the differences between open source and commercial. By purchasing an Access Manager license, you are entitled to support for both.
