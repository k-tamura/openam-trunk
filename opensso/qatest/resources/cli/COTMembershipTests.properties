#
# description - the purpose of the test case.
# create-setup-realms - a realm or realms that should be created before the
#         test is executed.  If multiple realms are created the realms should
#         be separated by a semi-colon (;) and should be in heirarchical order
#         (i.e. /realm1;/realm1/realm2;/realm1/realm2/realm3).
# create-setup-cots - one or more cots that should be created prior
#         to the execution of the test.  
# use-verbose-option - a binary property indicating whether the verbose option
#         should be used.
# use-debug-option - a binary property indicating whether the debug option
#         should be used.
# use-long-options - a binary property indicating whether the long form of
#         the options (e.g. "--realm") instead of the short form ("-e")
# message-to-find - one or more strings that should be present in the output
#         (for a test where expected-exit-code equals 0) or the error (for a
#         test where expected-exit-code does not equal 0).  Multiple strings
#         should be separated by a semi-colon (";").
# cot-realm - the realm in which the cot will be created.
# cot-name - the name of the cot which will be created.
# entityid - name of the entity
# metadatafile - location of standard metadata file
# extendeddatafile - location of extended data file
# midp - metaalias of idp
# msp - metaalias of sp
# optionalattributes - optional attributes of create-metadata-templ command
# This include:- --attrqueryprovider|-S, --attrauthority|-I, --authnauthority|-C
#         --xacmlpep|-e, --xacmlpdp|-p, --affiliation|-F, --affiownerid|-N,
#         --affimembers|-M, --spscertalias|-a, --idpscertalias|-b,

#         --xacmlpdpecertalias|-j, --xacmlpepecertalias|-z
# spec - specification of metadata
# extendedonly - Flag to have extended data file only
# expected-exit-code - the expected exit status for CLI command being issued.
#         Successful commands should return "0" and failed commands should
#         return a non-zero value.
