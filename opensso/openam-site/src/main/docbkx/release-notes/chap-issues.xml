  <title>Limitations</title>
  
  <para>ForgeRock supports the stable software releases that you can download
  from ForgeRock, not nightly builds or pre-release software. ForgeRock
  OpenAM downloads do not include OpenAM extensions. Therefore, ForgeRock does
  not support OpenAM extensions. If you have a special request for capabilities
  not currently in a software release, contact ForgeRock at <link
  xlink:href="mailto:info@forgerock.com">info@forgerock.com</link>.</para>
  
  <para>Do not run different versions of OpenAM together in the same OpenAM
  site.</para>

  <para>Not all features of OpenAM work with IPv6.</para>

  <para>The Database Repository type of data store is experimental and not
  supported for production use.</para>

  <!-- Fix for OPENAM-1032: Add details to the release notes and documentation of OpenAM (for 875) -->
  <para>By default OpenAM does not enforce session quotas when running in Site
  mode without session failover. To work around this behavior, set the server
  configuration property
  <literal>openam.session.useLocalSessionsInMultiServerMode=true</literal>.
  You can set this property in OpenAM console under Configuration &gt; Servers
  and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; Server Name &gt; Advanced.</para>
