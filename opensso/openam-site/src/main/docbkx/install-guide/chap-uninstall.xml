 <title>Removing OpenAM Software</title>

 <para>This chapter shows you how to uninstall OpenAM core software. See
 the <citetitle>Policy Agent Installation Guide</citetitle> for instructions
 on removing OpenAM agents.</para>

 <procedure xml:id="uninstall-OpenAM-core">
  <title>To Remove OpenAM Core Software</title>
  
  <para>After you have deployed and configured OpenAM core services, you have
  at least two, perhaps three or four, locations where OpenAM files are stored
  on your system.</para>
  
  <para>You remove the internal OpenAM configuration store when you follow
  the procedure below. If you used an external configuration store, you can
  remove OpenAM configuration data after removing all the software.</para>
  
  <step>
   <para>Shut down the web application container in which you deployed
   OpenAM.</para>
   <screen>$ /etc/init.d/tomcat stop
Password:
Using CATALINA_BASE:   /path/to/tomcat
Using CATALINA_HOME:   /path/to/tomcat
Using CATALINA_TMPDIR: /path/to/tomcat/temp
Using JRE_HOME:        /path/to/jdk1.6/jre
Using CLASSPATH:       /path/to/tomcat/bin/bootstrap.jar:
 /path/to/tomcat/bin/tomcat-juli.jar</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Unconfigure OpenAM by removing configuration files found in the $HOME
   directory of the user running the web application container.</para>
   <para>For a full install of OpenAM core services, configuration files
   include the configuration directory, <filename>$HOME/openam</filename>, and
   the hidden file that points to the configuration directory such as
   <filename>$HOME/.openssocfg/AMConfig_path_to_tomcat_webapps_openam_</filename>.</para>
   <screen>$ rm -rf $HOME/openam $HOME/.openssocfg</screen>
   <note>
    <para>At this point, you can restart the web container and configure
    OpenAM anew if you only want to start over with a clean configuration
    rather than removing OpenAM completely.</para>
   </note>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>Remove the OpenAM web application by removing the .war file and
   expanded web application from the container.</para>
   <screen>$ cd /path/to/tomcat/webapps/
$ rm -rf openam.war openam/</screen>
  </step>
  <step>
   <para>If you have stored a download or unpacked version of OpenAM software
   on your system, you can now remove the files.</para>
   <para>If you cannot find the original .zip, search for files named
   <filename>openam_*.zip</filename>.</para>
   <screen>$ find . -name "openam_*.zip"
./Downloads/openam_nightly_20110808.zip
$ rm ./Downloads/openam_nightly_20110808.zip</screen>
   <para>If you cannot find the unpacked version, you might search for the
   directory named <filename>deployable-war</filename>.</para>
   <screen>$ locate deployable-war/
/path/to/OpenAM/deployable-war/README
...
$ rm -rf /path/to/OpenAM</screen>
