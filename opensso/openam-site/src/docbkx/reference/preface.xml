  <para>Some items might be formatted differently from other text, like
  <filename>filenames</filename>, <command>commands</command>, and
  <literal>literal values</literal>.</para>
  
  <screen>$ echo Terminal sessions are formatted like this.

  <para>In many cases, sections pertaining to UNIX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, BSD,

  might be marked (Windows). To avoid repetition, however, file system
  directory names are often given only in UNIX format as in
  <filename>/path/to/OpenAM</filename>, even if the text applies to
  <filename>C:\path\to\OpenAM</filename> as well.</para>

  <title>Accessing OpenAM Documentation Online</title>
  
  <para>Core documentation, such as what you are now reading, aims to
  be technically accurate and complete with respect to the software
  documented. Core documentation therefore follows a <link
  xlink:href='https://wikis.forgerock.org/confluence/display/devcom/Documentation+Review+Process'
  >three-phase review process</link> designed to eliminate errors. The
  review process should slow authors down enough that documentation you get
  with a stable release has had time to bake fully.</para>
  
  <!-- TODO: online location of core documentation, perhaps docs.forgerock.org? -->
  <para>Fully baked core documentation is available at <link
  xlink:href='http://...'>...</link>.</para>
  
  <para>You need not wait until the core documentation is finished, though,
  to read more about OpenAM, and also to read about related topics that
  involve OpenAM without being strictly about OpenAM. The <link
  xlink:href='http://wikis.forgerock.org/openam/'>OpenAM Wiki</link> regularly
  brings you more, fresh content. In addition, you are welcome to <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> and then edit the Wiki if you notice an error, or if you
  have something to share.</para>

  <title>Joining the OpenAM Community</title>
  
  <para>After you <link
  xlink:href='https://idp.forgerock.org/openam/UI/Login?service=register'
  >sign up</link> at ForgeRock, you can also login to the Wiki and the issue
  database to follow what is happening with the project.</para>
  
  <para>If you have questions regarding OpenAM which are not answered by the
  documentation, there is a mailing list which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam</link> where you are
  likely to find an answer.</para>
  
  <para>The Wiki has information on how to check out OpenAM source code.
  There is also a mailing list for OpenAM development which can be found at
  <link xlink:href='https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam-dev'
  >https://lists.forgerock.org/mailman/listinfo/openam-dev</link>
  Should you want to contribute a patch, test, or feature, or want to author
  part of the core documentation, first have a look on the ForgeRock site
  at <link xlink:href='http://www.forgerock.com/fcpa-faq.html'>how to get
  involved</link>.</para>
