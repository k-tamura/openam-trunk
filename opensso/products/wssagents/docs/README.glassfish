This README contains instructions on how to secure web services using 
OpenAM WSS providers on SUN Application Server 9.1 (Glassfish V2).

This document assumes that users have already done the following:

1. Installed the SUN Application Server 9.1 that host the web services client (WSC) 
   and web services provider (WSP). 
2. Required Web services client and Web services provider applications are 
   implemented.
3. Installed and configured the OpenAM server.

Follow the steps below to secure the web services using OpenAM WSS
providers.

I. Install WSS Agent
Repeat the following steps on the machines where WSC and WSP are deployed:
1. Unzip openamwssproviders.zip to a desired directory,
   say <unzip_dir_of_openamwssproviders.zip>

2. Run the installer to install the WSS Agent.
 A. Stop the Application Server instance that the agent is to be
    installed on.

 B. On Unix/Linux machine,
      change directory to <unzip_dir_of_openamwssproviders.zip>/bin
      and chmod 755 wssagentadmin
    On Windows machine,
      change directory to <unzip_dir_of_openamwssproviders.zip>\bin

 C. On Unix/Linux machine, run
      ./wssagentadmin --install or ./wssagentadmin --custom-install
    On Windows machine, run
      wssagentadmin.bat --install or wssagentadmin.bat --custom-install
   (both --install and --custom-install options install the agent,
    however the --custom-install allows you to specify the application
    server instance name that you want the agent to install on; the
    --install assumes that the application server name is "server")

 C. If this is the first run of the installer wssagentadmin, then it
    asks you to read and agree the license information.

 D. Installer prompts for "Application Server Config Directory Path",
    enter the absolute path of the application server domain
    configuration directory.

 E. (only for --custom-install) Installer prompts for "name of the
    Application Server instance", enter the application server instance
    name.  In the case of Sun Application Server Enterprise Edition, a
    domain can have more than one application server instances. Enter
    the name of the application server instance that you want the agent
    to be installed on. The default server instance name is "server".

 F. Installer prompts for "URL where the OpenAM server is running",
    enter the OpenAM deployemnt URL in the format of
    protocol://host:port/deployURI.
    The protocol is either http or https; the host is the FQDN of the
    machine where OpenAM server is running; the deployURI is the OpenAM
    deployment URI. e.g. http://openam.sample.com:58080/openam
 G. Installer prompts for "Enter the Agent profile name", enter the 
    agent profile name. This agent user needs to have the permission to
    read the WSC and/or WSP profiles. Out of box, there is such an agent
    user named "agentAuth". It has permission to read the default 
    profiles "wsc", "wsp", and "SecurityTokenService".
 H. Installer prompts for "Enter the path to the password file", create
    a text file that contains the password of the agent profile user in
    clear text. By default the password for agentAuth is "changeit".
 I. This should conclude the user input process. The installer displays
    the summary of your responses, and you can choose
    "Continue with Installation" to start the agent installation.
 J. Restart the Application Server instance after the installation
    completes successfully.


II. Add Java security permissions 

On the Application Servers that host OpenAM server (OpenAM server),
Web Service Client application and Web Service Provider application :

If the Security Manager is "on", append the Java security permissions in
<unzip_dir_of_openamwssproviders.zip>/config/OpenSSOJavaPermissions.txt
to the server.policy file of the Application Server domain.

Each Application Server domain has its own standard J2SE policy file 
named server.policy. It is located in the 
/ApplicationServer-install/domains/<domain-name>/config directory. 
More information can be found in The server.policy File in Sun Java 
System Application Server 9 .1 Developer's Guide.


III. Configure the web services client and the web services provider for Web services security.

1.  Login into the OpenAM Console with user amadmin and <amadmin password>

    openamserver_protocol://openamserver_host:openamserver_port/openamserver_deploy_uri

    Note: If you have logged in as any other user, click Logout on the console page and Login again and make sure
    that you access the OpenAM Console.

    Create agent profiles for WSC and WSP (if not created out of box) :

      Go to Access Control -> Default realm -> Agents ->

        a) Create "WSC" profile
        Select Web Service Client -> under Agent, click "new" -> enter name as "wsc" and other required fields -> Save.
        Click on above saved profile to edit -> Select required Security Mechanism and "Is Request Signed" as true
        (checked).
        Save changes.
        Note : If the required or selected Security Mechanism is "STSSecurity", then 
        select STS Configuration as "SecurityTokenService" and Web Service End Point as "default".

        b) Create "WSP" profile
        Select Web Service Provider -> under Agent, click "new" -> enter name as "wsp" and other required fields -> Save.
        Click on above saved profile to edit -> Select all Security Mechanisms.
        Select Web Service End Point as "default" and "Is Request Signature Verified" as true (checked).
        Save changes.

2.  Logout of OpenAM Administration console.
