This README contains instructions on how to secure web services using 
OpenAM WSS providers on Glassfish V2 or SUN Application Server 9.1


General Description:
====================

The samples provided here are JAX-WS based web service, a web services
client and a standalone client.
The sample demonstrates a simple stock quote service where given
a stock ticker symbol it obtains stock data. The secure communication
between stock quote web services client is achieved using Federation
OpenAM web services security agents. The web services security
agents profile configuation is stored in backend repository information
like regular OpenAM agents.


The following diagram depicts a simple deployment scenario where the 
profiles of WSC and WSP are all hosted on a single OpenAM instance

Sections:
I.   Installing Glassfish and OpenAM
II.  Installing WSS Agents and Configuring WSC and WSP profiles
III. Building and Deploying the samples
IV.  Testing the sample.

Section I.

1. Install Glassfish that hosts the Web Services Client (WSC). 
2. Install Glassfish that hosts the Web Services Provider (WSP). 
3. Install Glassfish and deploy OpenAM on this Glassfish instance.
Note that the OpenAM server need not be deployed on Glassfish. They can
be deployed on any container. Only the WSC and WSP need to be on Glassfish.

Section II

Refer to the README.glassfish with the WSS Agent on installing WSS 
Agents on WSC/WSP containers and configuring WSC/WSP profiles
in OpenAM server.


III.  Building and Deploying the samples

The samples here are provided with convenient "ant" build script to
build and deploy the samples. This sample comes with two directories
StockQuoteClient and StockService which are for the web services client
and web service respectively. Also, it has a file name called as 
glassfish.properties. 

Repeat the steps on WSC and WSP machines:

1. Open glassfish.properties and edit for properties
    glassfish.home = <WSC/WSP Glassfish installation directory>
    glassfish.host = <WSC/WSP Host where glassfish is installed>
    glasfish.passwordfile = </tmp/app_passwd>
    
    Note: For the glassfish password file, make sure the password file
    is like this, and has read permissions
    AS_ADMIN_password=<password>

    The properties build.class.path and jaxws.endorsed.dir are not
    used for the stock samples, but for advanced samples.
       
2. Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to JDK1.5 installation and similarly
   make sure java and javac are in the PATH before executing the samples.

3. Use the ant command from <WSC/WSP-ApplicationServer-install>/lib/ant/bin/ant

4. The StockQuoteClient Sample assumes the web service (StockService)
   is deployed on localhost and port 8080. However, if they are different
   edit and replace localhost and 8080 in the following files: 

   StockQuoteClient/src/java/com/samples/GetQuote.java
   StockQuoteClient/src/java/com/samples/SOAPMessage.java

5. cd StockQuoteClient and run "ant all". This will build
   and deploy the StockQuoteClient onto glassfish container. Please make
   sure you run this on a WSC instance.

6. cd StockService and run "ant all". This will build
   and deploy the StockQuoteService onto glassfish container. Please make
   sure you run this on a WSP instance

Note: If you have logged in as any other user, click Logout on the console page and Login again and make sure that you access the OpenAM Console.


IV.  Testing the sample.

1. Access the stock quote client page.

   http://<wsc-host-name:portnumber>/StockQuoteClient/index.jsp

2. You will be redirected to OpenAM's Authentication service
   for end user login. Enter any existing OpenAM user with
   its password. Upon successful end user authentication, 
   you will be redirected back to 
   http://<host>:<port>/StockQuoteClient/ page.

3. Enter "JAVA" as stock ticker symbol and click "Get Quote".

4. If successful, this will display the stock values.
