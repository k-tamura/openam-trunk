%% 1. About this WAR

This WAR contains all the implementations for OpenAM server.
After the WAR is built, there will be a WAR file, openam.war under the
distribution directory, openam/products/amserver/built/war/dist. Deploy it
on a J2EE compliant web container. Visit a configuration page with a web
browser, click on a button to configure openam server. Then server is
ready for use.

After you have authenticated to the server, you will be brought to an
administrator console. where you can further configure/administer the
server.  Refer to http://openam.forgerock.org/doc/admin-guide/index.html for
more information

%% 2. Building the WAR

You can start the WAR build by issuing the "war" build target, (ant war).
Do a "ant clean" if you have previously build your workspace. Note that this
"war" target must be executed from within the workspace root directory 
located at opensso/products/amserver. Even though a build.xml file exists
under the opensso/products/amserver/war directory, it cannot be used 
directly since the war requires the complete workspace to be built prior
to its own compilation.

When you issue the war build target at the workspace root, the build target
of the main workspace is first invoked, after which the control is handed
to the war/build.xml build file for executing its default target. This 
results in the building of both the workspace and war sources together.

The shell commands are 
    cd <your-workspace/opensso/products/amserver
    ant clean
    ant war

The war build process does the followings

2.1.1 Compile the OpenAM source code under opensso/products/amserver/source
2.1.2 Compile the war source code under opensso/products/amserver/war/source
2.1.3 Create a WAR file that contains all the necessary resources. This WAR
      file is created at opensso/products/amserver/built/war/dist/opensso.war.

%% 3. Deploying the WAR
Deploy the web application, opensso/products/amserver/built/war/dist/opensso.war
with the deployment URI of <deploy-uri> in the web container designated for the
server host on the machine.

%% 4. Configuring the web application
Open a web browser (with Javascript and cookie enabled), visit
<protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/<deploy-uri> where <protocol>, <hostname>
and <port> are the protocol, hostname and port number of the web server
respectively.

You will be redirected to a configuration page,
<protocol>://<hostname>:<port>/<deploy-uri>/config/options.htm where you need to
go through the wizard and fill in the required fields
the page are already pre-popuplate with defaults values.

Click on the "Configure" button to start the configuration process.
This process will take approximately one minute to complete.
Once completed you can then access the login page.

Enter the username and password provided in the configurator page to
access the administration console. The default username is amadmin.
This user (amadmin) is the super user of the opensso system and has
permission to perform all administrative tasks.
