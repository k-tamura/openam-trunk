<a name="fufly"></a><h5>Federation Management</h5>
<p>Enables Federation Management. It is selected by default. To disable this feature, deselect
the field The Federation Management tab will not appear in the console.</p>

<a name="fsvge"></a><h5>User Management</h5>
<p>Enables User Management. This is enabled by default. This attribute is applicable when
OpenSSO is installed in legacy mode. </p>

<a name="fsvgj"></a><h5>People Containers</h5>
<p>This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable only when OpenSSO is
installed in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display people containers under the
Directory Management tab. It is recommended that you use a single people container
in your DIT and then use roles to manage accounts and services. The
default behavior of the OpenSSO console is to hide the People Containers. However, if
you have multiple people containers in your DIT, select this attribute to display
People Containers as managed objects.</p>

<a name="fsvgm"></a><h5>Organizational Unit Containers</h5>
<p>This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable when OpenSSO is installed
in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display containers in the Directory Management
tab.</p>

<a name="fsvgq"></a><h5>Group Containers</h5>
<p>This attribute is deselected by default and is applicable when OpenSSO is installed
in legacy mode. Selecting this attribute will display group containers in the Directory
Management tab.</p>

<a name="fsvgh"></a><h5>Managed Group Type</h5>
<p>Specifies whether subscription groups created through the console are static or dynamic. The
console will either create and display subscription groups that are static or dynamic,
not both. (Filtered groups are always supported regardless of the value given to
this attribute.) The default value is dynamic.</p>
<ul><li><p>A static group explicitly lists each group member using the <tt>groupOfNames</tt> or <tt>groupOfUniqueNames</tt> object class. The group entry contains the <i>uniqueMember</i> attribute for each member of the group. Members of static groups are manually added; the user entry itself remains unchanged. Static groups are suitable for groups with few members. </p></li>
<li><p>A dynamic group uses a <tt>memberOf</tt> attribute in the entry of each group member. Members of dynamic groups are generated through the use of an LDAP filter which searches and returns all entries which contain the <tt>memberOf</tt> attribute. Dynamic groups are suitable for groups that have a very large membership. </p></li>
<li><p>A filtered group uses an LDAP filter to search and return members that meet the requirement of the filter. For instance, the filter can generate members with a specific uid (<tt>uid=g*</tt>) or email address (<tt>mail=*@example.com</tt>). </p></li></ul>
<p>In the examples above, the LDAP filter would return all users whose uid
begins with <tt>g</tt> or whose email address ends with <tt>example.com</tt>, respectively. Filtered groups can
only be created within the User Management view by choosing Membership by Filter.</p><p>An administrator can select one of the following:</p>
<ul><li><p>Dynamic - Groups created through the Membership By Subscription option will be dynamic.</p></li>
<li><p>Static - Groups created through the Membership By Subscription option will be static.</p></li></ul>


<a name="fsvgr"></a><h5>Default Role Permissions</h5>
<p>Defines a list of default access control instructions (ACIs) or <b>permissions</b> that are
used to grant administrator privileges when creating new roles. Select one of these
ACIs for the level of privilege you wish. OpenSSO ships with four default
role permissions:</p><p>No Permissions &#8212; No permissions are to be set on the role.</p><p>Organization Admin &#8212; The Organization Administrator has read and write access to all
entries in the configured organization.</p><p>Organization Help Desk Admin &#8212; The Organization Help Desk Administrator has read access
to all entries in the configured organization and write access to the <tt>userPassword</tt>
attribute.</p><p>Organization Policy Admin &#8212; The Organization Policy Administrator has read and write access
to all policies in the realm. The Organization Policy Administrator can not create
a referral policy.  </p>

<a name="fsvgt"></a><h5>Domain Component Tree</h5>
<p>The Domain Component tree (DC tree) is a specific DIT structure used by
many Sun Java System components to map between DNS names and realm entries.</p><p>When this option is enabled, the DC tree entry for an realm is
created, provided that the DNS name of the realm is entered at the
time the realm is created. The DNS name field will appear in
the realm Create page. This option is only applicable to top-level realms, and will
not be displayed for subrealms.</p><p>Any status change made to the <i>inetdomainstatus</i> attribute through the OpenSSO SDK in
the realm tree will update the corresponding DC tree entry status. (Updates to
status that are not made through the OpenSSO SDK will not be synchronized.)
For example, if a new realm, sun, is created with the DNS name
attribute <tt>sun.com</tt> , the following entry will be created in the DC tree:</p><p><tt>dc=sun,dc=com,o=internet,root suffix</tt></p><p>By default, this is set to the OpenSSO root. If a different suffix
is desired, this suffix must be created using LDAP commands. The ACIs for
administrators that create realms required modification so that they have unrestricted access to
the new DC tree root.</p>

<a name="fsvgs"></a><h5>Administrative Groups</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to create the DomainAdministrators and DomainHelpDeskAdministrators groups. If enabled, these groups
are created and associated with the Organization Admin Role and Organization Help Desk
Admin Role, respectively. Once created, adding or removing a user to one of
these associated roles automatically adds or removes the user from the corresponding group. This
behavior, however, does not work in reverse. Adding or removing a user to
one of these groups will not add or remove the user in the
user's associated roles.</p><p>The DomainAdministrators and DomainHelpDeskAdministrators groups are only created in realms that are created
after this option is enabled.  </p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>This option does not apply to subrealms, with the exception of the root
realm. At the root realm, the ServiceAdministrators and ServiceHelpDesk Administrators groups are created
and associated with the Top-level Admin and Top-level Help Desk Admin roles, respectively. The
same behavior applies.</p>
<hr>


<a name="fsvgv"></a><h5>Compliance User Deletion</h5>
<p>Specifies whether a user's entry will be deleted, or just marked as deleted,
from the directory. This attribute is only applicable when OpenSSO is installed in
legacy mode.</p><p>When a user's entry is deleted and this option is selected (true), the
user's entry will still exist in the directory, but will be marked as
deleted. User entries that are marked for deletion are not returned during Directory
Server searches. If this option is not selected, the user's entry will be
deleted from the directory.</p>

<a name="fsvgu"></a><h5>Dynamic Administrative Roles ACIs</h5>
<p>This attribute defines the access control instructions for the administrator roles that are
created dynamically when a group or realm is configured using OpenSSO. These roles
are used for granting administrative privileges for the specific grouping of entries created.
The default ACIs can be modified only under this attribute listing.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>Administrators at the realm level have a wider scope of access than do
group administrators. But, by default, when a user is added to a group
administrator role, that user can change the password of anyone in the group.
This would include any realm administrator who is a member of that group.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Container Help Desk Admin role has read access to all entries in a realm and write
access to the <i>userPassword</i> attribute in user entries only in this container
unit.</p><p>The Realm Help Desk Admin has read access to all entries in a
realm and write access to the <i>userPassword</i> attribute.  When a sub&#8212;realm is created,
remember that the administration roles are created in the sub-realm, not in the
parent realm.</p><p>The Container Admin role has read and write access to all entries in
an LDAP organizational unit. In OpenSSO, the LDAP organizational unit is often referred
to as a container.</p><p>The Organization Policy Administrator has read and write access to all policies, and
can create, assign, modify, and delete all policies within that realm.</p><p>ThePeople Container Admin is by default, any user entry in an newly created
realm is a member of that realm's People Container. The People Container Administrator
has read and write access to all user entries in the realm's People
Container. Keep in mind that this role DOES NOT have read and write
access to the attributes that contain role and group DNs therefore, they cannot
modify the attributes of, or remove a user from, a role or a
group.</p><p>Other containers can be configured with OpenSSO to hold user entries, group entries
or even other containers. To apply an Administrator role to a container created
after the realm has already been configured, the Container Admin Role or Container
Help Desk Admin defaults would be used.</p><p>The Group Admin has read and write access to all members of a
specific group, and can create new users, assign users to the groups they
manage, and delete the users the that they have created. When a group
is created, the Group Administrator role is automatically generated with the necessary privileges
to manage the group. The role is not automatically assigned to a group
member. It must be assigned by the group's creator, or anyone that has
access to the Group Administrator Role.</p><p>The Top-level Admin has read and write access to all entries in the
top-level realm. In other words, this Top-level Admin role has privileges for every
configuration principal within the OpenSSO application.</p><p>The Organization Administrator has read and write access to all entries in a
realm. When a realm is created, the Organization Admin role is automatically generated
with the necessary privileges to manage the realm.</p>

<a name="ftbxa"></a><h5>User Profile Service Classes</h5>
<p>Lists the services that will have a custom display in the User Profile
page. The default display generated by the console may not be sufficient for
some services. This attribute creates a custom display for any service, giving full
control over what and how the service information is displayed. The syntax is
as follows:</p><p><tt>service name | relative url()</tt></p><p>Services that are listed in this attribute will not display in the User
Create pages. Any data configuration for a custom service display must be performed
the User Profile pages.</p>

<a name="fsvgw"></a><h5>DC Node Attribute List</h5>
<p>Defines the set of attributes that will be set in the DC
tree entry when an object is created. The default parameters are:</p><table><tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>maildomainwelcomemessage</p></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top" scope="row"><p>preferredmailhost</p></td>

<a name="fsvgx"></a><h5>Search Filters for Deleted Objects</h5>
<p>Defines the search filters for objects to be removed when User Compliance Deletion
mode is enabled.</p>

<a name="fsvgy"></a><h5>Default People Container</h5>
<p>Specifies the default people container into which the user is created.</p>

<a name="fsvhe"></a><h5>Default Groups Container</h5>
<p>Specifies the default groups container into which the group is created.</p>

<a name="fsvhd"></a><h5>Default Agents Container</h5>
<p>Specifies the default agent container into which the agent is created. The default
is <tt>Agents</tt>.</p>

<a name="fsvhb"></a><h5>Groups Default People Container</h5>
<p>Specifies the default People Container where users will be placed when they are
created. There is no default value. A valid value is the DN of
a people container. See the note under Groups People Container List attribute for
the People Container fallback order.</p>

<a name="fsvha"></a><h5>Groups People Container List</h5>
<p>Specifies a list of People Containers from which a Group Administrator can choose
when creating a new user. This list can be used if there are
multiple People Containers in the directory tree. (If no People Containers are specified
in this list or in the Groups Default People Container field, users are
created in the default OpenSSO people container, <tt>ou=people</tt>.) There is no default
value for this field.</p><p>The syntax for this attribute is:</p><p><tt></tt><i>dn of group</i><tt> | </tt><i>dn of people container</i><tt></tt>   </p><p>When a user is created, this attribute is checked for a container in
which to place the entry. If the attribute is empty, the Groups Default
People Container attribute is checked for a container. If the latter attribute is
empty, the entry is created under <tt>ou=people</tt> .</p><p>This attribute is only applicable when OpenSSO is installed in legacy mode. There
is no default value.</p>

<a name="fsvhc"></a><h5>User Profile Display Class</h5>
<p>Specifies the Java class used by the OpenSSO console when it displays the
User Profile pages.</p>

<a name="fsvhh"></a><h5>End User Profile Display Class</h5>
<p>Specifies the Java class used by the OpenSSO console when it displays the
End User Profile pages.</p>

<a name="fsvhi"></a><h5>Show Roles on User Profile Page</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to display a list of roles assigned to a user as
part of the user's User Profile page. If the parameter is not
enabled (the default), the User Profile page shows the user's roles only for administrators.</p>

<a name="fsvhj"></a><h5>Show Groups on User Profile Page</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to display a list of groups assigned to a user as
part of the user's User Profile page. If this parameter is not enabled
(the default), the User Profile page shows the user's groups only for administrators.</p>

<a name="fsvhf"></a><h5>User Self Subscription to Group</h5>
<p>This parameter specifies whether users can add themselves to groups that are open
to subscription. If the parameter is not enabled (the default), the user profile
page allows the user's group membership to be modified only by an administrator.
This parameter applies only when the Show Groups on User Profile Page option
is selected.</p>

<a name="fsvhk"></a><h5>User Profile Display Options</h5>
<p>This menu specifies which service attributes will be displayed in the user profile
page. An administrator can select from the following:</p><dl><dt>UserOnly</dt>
<dd><p>Display viewable User schema attributes for services assigned to the user. User service attribute values are viewable by the user when the attribute contains the keyword Display. See the OpenSSO Developer's Guide for details.</p></dd>
<dt>Combined</dt>
<dd><p>Display viewable User and Dynamic schema attributes for services assigned to the user.</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="fsvhl"></a><h5>User Creation Default Roles</h5>
<p>This listing defines roles that will be assigned to newly created users automatically.
There is no default value. An administrator can input the DN of one
or more roles.  </p><p>This field only takes a full Distinguished Name address, not a role name.
The roles can only be OpenSSO roles, not LDAP (Directory Server) roles.</p>

<a name="fsvhm"></a><h5>Administrative Console Tabs</h5>
<p>This field lists the Java classes of modules that will be displayed at
the top of the console. The syntax is <tt>i18N key | java class name</tt>.</p><p>The i18N key is used for the localized name of the entry
in the console.</p>

<a name="fsvho"></a><h5>Maximum Results Returned From Search</h5>
<p>This field defines the maximum number of results returned from a search. The
default value is 200.  </p><p>Do not set this attribute to a large value (greater than 1000) unless
sufficient system resources are allocated.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>OpenSSO is preconfigured to return a maximum size of 4000 search entries. 
This value can be changed through the console or by using <tt>ldapmodify</tt>. If
you wish to change it using <tt>ldapmodify,</tt>create a <tt>newConfig.xml</tt>, with the following values (in
this example, <tt>nsSizeLimit</tt>: -1 means unlimited):</p>dn: cn=puser,ou=DSAME Users,ORG_ROOT_SUFFIX changetype: modify replace:nsSizeLimit nsSizeLimit: -1<p>Then, run <tt>ldapmodify</tt>. For example:</p>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/SUNWam/lib/:/opt/SUNWam/ldaplib/ldapsdk:/usr/lib/mps:/usr/share/lib/mps/secv1:/usr/lib/mps/secv1: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH  ./ldapmodify -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w "iplanet333" -c -a -h hostname.domain -p 389 -f  newConfig.xml<p>Modifications to this attribute done through <tt>LDAPModify</tt> will take precedence to those
made through the OpenSSO Console. </p>
<hr>


<a name="fsvhp"></a><h5>Timeout For Search</h5>
<p>Defines the amount of time (in number of seconds) that a search will
continue before timing out. It is used to stop potentially long searches. After
the maximum search time is reached, the search terminates and returns an error.
The default is 5 seconds.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>Directory Server is been preconfigured with a timeout value of 120 seconds. This
value can be changed through the Directory Server console or by using <tt>ldapmodify.</tt>
 If you wish to change it using <tt>ldapmodify,</tt>create a <tt>newConfig.xml</tt>, with the
following values (this example changes the timeout from 120 seconds to 3600 seconds):</p>dn: cn=config changetype: modify replace:nsslapd-timelimit nsslapd-timelimit: 3600<p>Then, run <tt>ldapmodify</tt>. For example:</p>setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/SUNWam/lib/:/opt/SUNWam/ldaplib/ldapsdk:/usr/lib/mps:/usr/share/lib/mps/secv1:/usr/lib/mps/secv1: $LD_LIBRARY_PATH  ./ldapmodify -D "cn=Directory Manager" -w "iplanet333" -c -a -h hostname.domain -p 389 -f  newConfig.xml
<hr>


<a name="fsvhs"></a><h5>JSP Directory Name</h5>
<p>Specifies the name of the directory that contains the JSP files for a
realm. It allows administrator to have different appearance (customization) for different realm. The
default value for this attribute is <tt>console</tt>. This attribute is applicable only when OpenSSO
is installed in legacy mode. </p>

<a name="fsvhr"></a><h5>Online Help Documents</h5>
<p>This field lists the online help links that will be created on the
main OpenSSO help page. This allows other applications to add their online help
links in the OpenSSO page. The format for this attribute is:</p><p><tt>linki18nkey | html page to load | i18n properties file | remote server</tt>  </p><p>The remote server attribute is an optional argument that allows you to specify
the remote server on which the online help document is located. The default
value is:</p><p><tt>DSAME Help|/contents.html|amAdminModlueMsgs</tt></p><p>This attribute is only applicable when OpenSSO is installed in legacy mode.</p>

<a name="fsvhq"></a><h5>Required Services</h5>
<p>This field lists the services that are dynamically added to the users' entries
when they are created. Administrators can choose which services are added at the
time of creation. This attribute is not used by the console, but by
the OpenSSO SDK. Users that are dynamically created by the <tt>amadmin</tt> command line
utility will be assigned the services listed in this attribute.</p>

<a name="fsvhu"></a><h5>User Search Key</h5>
<p>This attribute defines the attribute name that is to be searched upon when
performing a simple search in the Navigation page. The default value for this
attribute is <tt>cn</tt>.</p><p>For example, if you enter <tt>j*</tt> in the Name field in the Navigation
frame, users whose names begins with "j" or "J" will be displayed.</p>

<a name="fsvht"></a><h5>User Search Return Attribute</h5>
<p>This field defines the attribute name used when displaying the users returned from
a simple search. The default of this attribute is uid cn. This will
display the user ID and the user's full name.</p><p>The attribute name that is listed first is also used as the key
for sorting the set of users that will be returned. To avoid
performance degradation, use an attribute whose value is set in a user's entry.</p>

<a name="fsvhv"></a><h5>User Creation Notification List</h5>
<p>This field defines a list of email addresses that will be sent notification
when a new user is created. Multiple email addresses can be specified, as
in the following syntax:</p><p> <tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt> </p><p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt> </p><p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt></p><p>The notification list also accepts different locales by using the <tt>-|locale</tt> option.</p><p>See <a href="supportedlang.html">Supported Language Locales</a>for a list of locales.  </p><p>The sender email ID can be changed by modifying property 497 in <tt>amProfile.properties</tt>,
which is located, by default, at <tt></tt><i>OpenSSO-base</i><tt>/SUNWam/locale</tt> .</p>

<a name="fsvhw"></a><h5>User Deletion Notification List</h5>
<p>This field defines a list of email addresses that will be sent notification
when a user is deleted. Multiple email addresses can be specified, as in
the following syntax:</p><p> <tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt> </p><p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt> </p><p><tt>e-mail|locale|charset</tt></p><p>The notification list also accepts different locales by using the <tt>-|locale</tt> option.</p><p>See for a list of local<a href="supportedlang.html">Supported Language Locales</a>.  </p><p>The sender email ID can be changed by modifying property 497 in <tt>amProfile.properties</tt>,
which is located, by default, at <tt></tt><i>OpenSSO-base</i><tt>/SUNWam/locale</tt> .</p><p>The default sender ID is <tt>DSAME</tt>.</p>

<a name="fsvhx"></a><h5>User Modification Notification List</h5>
<p>Defines a list of attributes and email addresses associated with the attribute. When
a user modification occurs on an attribute defined in the list, the email
address associated with the attribute will be sent notification. Each attribute can have
a different set of addresses associated to it. Multiple email address can be
specified, as in the following syntax:</p><p><tt>attrName </tt><i>e-mail</i><tt>| </tt><i>locale</i><tt>|</tt><i>charset</i><tt> </tt><i>e-mail</i><tt> |</tt><i>locale</i><tt>|</tt><i>charset</i><tt> .....</tt> </p><p><tt>attrName </tt><i>e-mail</i><tt>| </tt><i>locale</i><tt>|</tt><i>charset</i><tt> </tt><i>e-mail</i><tt> |</tt><i>locale</i><tt>|</tt><i>charset</i><tt> .....</tt> </p><p>The <tt>-self</tt> keyword may be used in place of one of the addresses.
This sends mail to the user whose profile was modified. For example, assume
the following:</p><p><tt>manager someuser@sun.com|self|admin@sun.com</tt></p><p>Mail will be sent to the address specified in the manager attribute, 
<tt>someuser@sun.com</tt>, <tt>admin@sun</tt>, the person who modified the user (self).</p><p>The notification list also accepts different locales by using the <tt>-|locale</tt> option. For
example, to send the notification to an administrator in France:</p><p><tt>manager someuser@sun.com|self|admin@sun.com|fr</tt> See<a href="supportedlang.html">Supported Language Locales</a> for a list of locales.  </p><p>The attribute name is the same as it appears in the Directory Server
schema, and not as the display name in the console.</p>

<a name="fsvia"></a><h5>Maximum Entries Displayed per Page</h5>
<p>This attribute allows you to define the maximum rows that can be displayed
per page. The default is 25. For example, if a user search returns
100 rows, there will be 4 pages with 25 rows displayed in each
page.</p>

<a name="fsvhz"></a><h5>Event Listener Classes</h5>
<p>This attribute contains a list of listeners that receive creation, modification and deletion
events from the OpenSSO console.</p>

<a name="fsvhy"></a><h5>Pre and Post Processing Classes</h5>
<p>This field defines a list of implementation classes through plug-ins that extend the
<tt>com.iplanet.am.sdk.AMCallBack</tt> class to receive callbacks during pre and post processing operations for users, realm,
roles and groups. The operations are:</p>
<ul><li><p>create</p></li>
<li><p>delete</p></li>
<li><p>modify</p></li>
<li><p>add users to roles/groups</p></li>
<li><p>delete users from roles/groups</p></li></ul>
<p>You must enter the full class name of the plug-in and then
change the class path of your web container (from the OpenSSO installation base) to
include the full path to the location of the plug-in class</p>

<a name="fsvic"></a><h5>External Attributes Fetch</h5>
<p>This option enables callbacks for plug-ins to retrieve external attributes (any external application-specific
attribute). External attributes are not cached in the OpenSSO SDK, so this attribute
allows you enable attribute retrieval per realm level. By default, this option is not
enabled</p>

<a name="fsvib"></a><h5>Invalid User ID Characters</h5>
<p>This attribute defines a list of characters that are not allowed in a
user's name. Each character must be separated by the | character. For example:</p><p><tt>*|(|)|&#38;|!</tt></p>

<a name="fsvie"></a><h5>UserID and Password Validation Plug-in Class</h5>
<p>This class provides a userID and password validation plug-in mechanism. The methods of
this class need to be overridden by the implementation plug-in modules that validate
the userID and/or password for the user. The implementation plug-in modules will be
invoked whenever a userID or password value is being added or modified using
the OpenSSO console, the <tt>amadmin</tt> command line interface, or using the SDK.</p><p>The plug-ins that extend this class can be configured per realm. If a
plug-in is not configured for an realm, then the plug-in configured at the
global level will be used.</p><p>If the validation of the plug-in fails, the plug-in module can throw an
exception to notify the application to indicate the error in the userID or
password supplied by the user.</p>
