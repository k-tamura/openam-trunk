<a name="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthcertservice"></a><h4>Certificate</h4>
<p><a name="indexterm-169"></a>This module enables a user to log in through a personal digital certificate
(PDC). The module instance can require the use of the Online Certificate Status
Protocol (OCSP) to determine the state of a certificate. Use of the OCSP
is optional. The user is granted or denied access to a resource based
on whether or not the certificate is valid. The Certificate authentication attributes are realm
attributes. The attributes are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href="#fwbia">Match Certificate in LDAP</a></p></li>

<li><p><a href="#fwblx">Authentication Level</a></p></li></ul>


<a name="fwbia"></a><h5>Match Certificate in LDAP</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to check if the user certificate presented at login is stored
in the LDAP Server. If no match is found, the user is denied
access. If a match is found and no other validation is required, the
user is granted access. The default is that the Certificate Authentication service does
not check for the user certificate.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>A certificate stored in the Directory Server is not necessarily valid; it may
be on the certificate revocation list. See <a href="#fwbim">Match Certificate to CRL</a>. However, the web container may
check the validity of the user certificate presented at login.</p>
<hr>


<a name="fwbiq"></a><h5>Subject DN Attribute Used to Search LDAP for Certificates</h5>
<p>Specifies the attribute of the certificate's <i>SubjectDN</i> value that will be used to
search LDAP for certificates. This attribute must uniquely identify a user entry. The
actual value will be used for the search. The default is <tt>cn</tt>.</p>

<a name="fwbim"></a><h5>Match Certificate to CRL</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to compare the user certificate against the Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
in the LDAP Server. The CRL is located by one of the attribute
names in the issuer's <i>SubjectDN</i>. If the certificate is on the CRL, the
user is denied access; if not, the user is allowed to proceed. This
attribute is, by default, not enabled.</p><p>Certificates should be revoked when the owner of the certificate has changed status
and no longer has the right to use the certificate or when the
private key of a certificate owner has been compromised.</p>

<a name="fwbik"></a><h5>Issuer DN Attribute Used to Search LDAP for CRLs</h5>
<p>Specifies the attribute of the received certificate's issuer  <i>subjectDN</i> value that will
be used to search LDAP for CRLs. This field is used only when
the Match Certificate to CRL attribute is enabled. The actual value will be
used for the search. The default is <tt>cn</tt>.</p>

<a name="fwbin"></a><h5>HTTP Parameters for CRL Update</h5>
<p>Specifies the HTTP parameters for obtaining a CRL from a servlet for a
CRL update. Contact the administrator of your CA for these parameters.</p>

<a name="fwbil"></a><h5>OCSP Validation</h5>
<p>Enables OCSP validation to be performed by contacting the corresponding OCSP responder. The
OCSP responder is decided as follows during runtime. The attributes mentioned are located
in the console at Configuration > Servers and Sites > Security:</p>
<ul><li><p>If this value is set to true and the OCSP responder is set in the<a href="service.servereditsecurity.html#ggkav">Responder URL</a> attribute, the value of the attribute will be used as the OCSP responder.</p></li>
<li><p>If <a href="service.servereditsecurity.html#ggkaa">Online Certificate Status Protocol Check</a> is enabled and if the value of this attribute is not set, the OCSP responder presented in your client certificate is used as the OCSP responder. </p></li>
<li><p>If <a href="service.servereditsecurity.html#ggkaa">Online Certificate Status Protocol Check</a> is not enabled or if <a href="service.servereditsecurity.html#ggkaa">Online Certificate Status Protocol Check</a> is enabled and if an OCSP responder can not be found, no OCSP validation will be performed.</p></li></ul>
<p>Before enabling OCSP Validation, make sure that the time of the OpenSSO machine
and the OCSP responder machine are in sync as close as possible. Also,
the time on the OpenSSO machine must not be behind the time on
the OCSP responder. For example:</p><p><tt>OCSP responder machine - 12:00:00 pm</tt></p><p><tt>OpenSSO machine - 12:00:30 pm</tt> </p>

<a name="fwbij"></a><h5>LDAP Server Where Certificates are Stored</h5>
<p>Specifies the name and port number of the LDAP server where the certificates
are stored. The default value is the host name and port specified when
OpenSSO was installed. The host name and port of any LDAP Server where
the certificates are stored can be used. The format is <tt>hostname:port</tt>.</p>

<a name="fwbtp"></a><h5>LDAP Start Search DN</h5>
<p>Specifies the DN of the node where the search for the user's certificate
should start. There is no default value. The field will recognize any valid
DN.</p><p>Multiple entries must be prefixed by the local server name. The format is
as follows:</p><p><tt>servername|search dn</tt> </p><p>For multiple entries:</p><p><tt>servername1|search dn servername2|search dn servername3|search dn...</tt></p><p>If multiple entries exist under the root organization with the same user ID,
then this parameter should be set so that the only one entry can
be searched for or found in order to be authenticated. For example, in
the case where the agent ID and user ID is same under root
org, this parameter should be <tt>ou=Agents</tt> for the root organization to authenticate using
Agent ID and <tt>ou=People,</tt> for the root organization to authenticate using User
ID.</p>

<a name="fwbqp"></a><h5>LDAP Server Principal User</h5>
<p>This field accepts the DN of the principal user for the LDAP server
where the certificates are stored. There is no default value for this field
which will recognize any valid DN. The principal user must be authorized to
read, and search certificate information stored in the Directory Server.</p>

<a name="fwbst"></a><h5>LDAP Server Principal Password</h5>
<p>This field carries the LDAP password associated with the user specified in the
LDAP Server Principal User field. There is no default value for this field
which will recognize the valid LDAP password for the specified principal user.  This
value is stored as readable text in the directory.</p>

<a name="fwbiu"></a><h5>LDAP Server Principal Password (confirm)</h5>
<p>Confirm the password.</p>

<a name="fwblm"></a><h5>Use SSL for LDAP Access</h5>
<p>Specifies whether to use SSL to access the LDAP server. The default is
that the Certificate Authentication service does not use SSL for LDAP access.</p>

<a name="fwbof"></a><h5>Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile</h5>
<p>Specifies which field in the certificate's Subject DN should be used to search
for a matching user profile. For example, if you choose email address, the
certificate authentication service will search for the user profile that matches the attribute
<i>emailAddr</i>  in the user certificate. The user logging in then uses the
matched profile. The default field is <i>subject CN</i>. The list contains:</p>
<ul><li><p>email address</p></li>
<li><p>subject CN</p></li>
<li><p>subject DN</p></li>
<li><p>subject UID</p></li>
<li><p>other</p></li></ul>


<a name="fwbna"></a><h5>Other Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile</h5>
<p>If the value of the Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile attribute
is set to other, then this field specifies the attribute that will be
selected from the received certificate's <i>subjectDN</i>  value. The authentication service will
then search the user profile that matches the value of that attribute.</p>

<a name="ggumk"></a><h5>SubjectAltNameExt Value Type to Access User Profile</h5>
<p>If any value type other than <tt>none</tt> is selected, this attribute has precedence
over <tt>Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile</tt> or <tt>Other Certificate Field Used to Access User Profile</tt>attribute.</p>
<ul><li><p>RFC822Name</p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p>UPN</p></li></ul>


<a name="fwbiw"></a><h5>Trusted Remote Hosts</h5>
<p>Defines a list of trusted hosts that can be trusted to send certificates
to OpenSSO. OpenSSO must verify whether the certificate emanated from one of these
hosts. This attribute is used for the Portal Server gateway, for a load
balancer with SSL termination and for Distributed Authentication. </p><dl><dt>none</dt>
<dd><p>Disables the attribute. This is set by default.</p></dd>
<dt>all</dt>
<dd><p>Accepts Portal Server Gateway-style certificate authentication from any client IP address.</p></dd>
<dt>IP ADDR</dt>
<dd><p>Lists the IP addresses from which to accept Portal Server Gateway-style certificate authentication requests (the IP Address of the Gateway(s)). The attribute is configurable on an realm basis.</p></dd>
</dl>


<a name="fwbkd"></a><h5>SSL Port Number</h5>
<p>Specifies the port number for the secure socket layer. Currently, this attribute is
only used by the Gateway servlet. Before you add or change an SSL
Port Number, see the "Policy-Based Resource Management" section in the OpenSSO Administration Guide.</p>

<a name="gcabp"></a><h5>HTTP Header Name for Client Certificate</h5>
<p>This attribute is used only when the Trusted Remote Hosts attribute is set
to all or has a specific host name defined. The administrator must specify
the http header name for the client certificate that is inserted by the
load balancer or SRA. </p>

<a name="fwblx"></a><h5>Authentication Level</h5>
<p>The authentication level is set separately for each method of authentication. The value
indicates how much to trust an authentication mechanism. Once a user has authenticated,
this value is stored in the SSO token for the session. When the
SSO token is presented to an application the user wants to access, the
application uses the stored value to determine whether the level is sufficient to
grant the user access. If the authentication level stored in an SSO token does
not meet the minimum value required, the application can prompt the user to
authenticate again through a service with a higher authentication level. The default value
is 0.</p>
<hr><p><b>Note &#8211; </b>If no authentication level is specified, the SSO token stores the value specified
in the Core authentication attribute <a href="service.scserviceprofile.iplanetamauthservice.html#fwbfn">Default Authentication Level</a>.</p>
