=============================================================
    This document describes the steps to upgrade/migrate to

OpenSSO 8.0 from the following OpenSSO and 
Sun Java System Federation Manager versions : 

    Sun Java System Access Manager (AM)
        - JES 3 2005Q1 (AM 6.3)
        - JES 4 2005Q4 (AM 7.0)
        - JES 5 (AM 7.1)

      Federation Manager 7.0 

=================================================================
Upgrade Steps to migrate Sun Java System Access Manager & 
Federation Manager to OpenSSO 8.0
=================================================================

i. Pre-Upgrade steps :

   Before attempting upgrade, pre-upgrade steps must be followed,
   these include :
        - Update OS version to OpenSSO 8.0 supported version.
	- Update of the Web Container to OpenSSO 8.0 supported
          versions
        - Update of the Directory Server version to the OpenSSO 8.0
          supported version.
        - Update of shared components (eg. JDK version ).
        - Collection of configuration parameters such as passwords,
          encryption keys , admin user information , directory administrator
          information, deploy uri of existing AM instance.
        - Backup of the OpenSSO schema (dump to an ldif) before
          attempting upgrade.
        - Backup of customized configuration (eg. customized jsps).

   Pre-upgrade steps are explained in detail in the OpenSSO 8.0
   Upgrade Guide which can be found at: http://docs.sun.com/doc/820-5019

ii. Download the OpenSSO 8.0 zip file (opensso.zip)

iii. Select a directory and extract the zip file into this directory.
     Note: This directory should be readable and writable.
     This will be referred to as upgrade base directory which would be
     <zip-dir>/opensso.

iv. Create a staging directory 
       - Extract the opensso.war into the staging directory.
       - apply customizations (console, auth jsp etc)
       - Create a war from this staging directory and the name of the
         war should be same as the deploy uri of the previous AM
         version . Eg. If the existing instance is deployed with uri
         /amserver then the new war should be re-wared as amserver.war.

v. Undeploy existing instance war and deploy the OpenSSO 8.0 war
   using web container's deployment commands or container's administration
   console.
    1. Undeploy the existing deployed war.
    2. Deploy the OpenSSO 8.0 war on same host and port where
       previous instance was deployed. 

vi. Restart the container.

vii. Configure the war against the existing AM schema.
     > Following configuration parameters are needed from the
         existing install for configuration
        - AM Administrator (amAdmin) password.
	- Server Settings
	    * Server Host
	    * Server Port
	    * Cookie Domain
	    * Deploy URI
        - Directory Server Settings
	    * Directory Server Host Name
	    * Directory Server Port
	    * Encryption Key (this should be the value of
              the "am.encryption.pwd" property from AMConfig.properties)
	    * Directory Administrator LoginID (eg. cn=Directory Manager)
	    * Directory Administrator Password
        - Root Suffix  (this should be the value of the property 
              "com.iplanet.am.rootsuffix" from AMConfig.properties).
        - "amldapuser" password

    > Invoke the OpenSSO 8.0 deployment url to configure OpenSSO 8.0 
      against existing DIT :
	<protocol>://<serverhost>:<serverport>/<deploy_uri>

    > On the Configuration Page , select "Create New Configuration".
          This will take to the screen "Step 1 : General"

    > Step 1: General : Enter the amAdmin password and select "Next"
          to go to Step 2

    > Step 2: Server Settings : Verify the server host , server port,
      cookie domain and the deploy uri . These values should be same
      as that of the AM version which is being migrated.

      Click on "Next" to go to Step 3.

    > Step 3: Configuration Store : Enter the configuration store details

	- Select DataStore Type "External (Sun Java System DS)
	- Enter the values of the following from the existing AM instance:
	      o Directory Server Host Name
	      o Directory Server Port
              o Encryption Key 
	      o Root Suffix
              o LoginID  (Directory Server Admin DN)
              o Password (Directory Server Admin Password)
	- Select "Next" to go to Step 4.

    > Step 4: User Store: Enter the User Store details :

	 - Enter the values of the following from the existing AM instance:
	      o Directory Server Host Name
	      o Directory Server Port
	      o Root Suffix
              o LoginID  (Directory Server Admin DN)
              o Password (Directory Server Admin Password)

        - Select Store Type "LDAP with OpenSSO Schema"
	- Select "Next" to go to Step 5

    > Step 5: Site Configuration - No Data needs to be entered on this screen
	- Select "Next" to go to Step 6.

    > Step 6: Default Agent User
	- Enter "amldapuser" password
	- Select "Next" to go to Summary.

    > Step 7: Summary 
	- Select "Create Configuration"

    > Select "Proceed To Login" on Complete of the Configuration.

    > Login to OpenSSO Admin Console.

    > At this point OpenSSO 8.0 is running against existing DIT
      (also known as coexistance mode).
        
viii.  Prepare the system for upgrade by running the preupgrade tool.
        - Change to <upgrade_base_dir>/upgrade/scripts.
        - Run the "ssopre80upgrade" tool . 

	  Solaris Sparc/x86 & Linux : At the command prompt enter :
	    ./ssopre80upgrade 

	  Windows : At the command prompt enter :

    - "ssopre80upgrade" will require the following inputs :
	o FM 7.0 Staging Directory (if the instance is FM)
	o Directory Server full qualified host name
	o Directory Server port
	o Top-level Administrator DN
	o Top-level Adminisrator Password
	o Directory to store backup.
	o OpenSSO 8.0 Configuration Directory

	o OpenSSO 8.0 Staging Directory 

ix. Update the <upgrade-base-dir>/upgrade/config/ssoUpgradeConfig.properties
    to set the following properties 
        o XML_ENCODING - Enter the value of the XML_ENCODING eg. UTF-8
        o BASEDIR - Enter the value of the upgrade base directory 
                     (eg <zip-dir>/opensso)

        o LDAP_USER_PASS - Value of the "amldapuser" password

x. Upgrade/Migrate the AM Schema to OpenSSO 8.0 schema.
    - Change to <upgrade_base_dir>/upgrade/scripts.
        - Run the "ssoupgrade" tool . 

	  Solaris Sparc/x86 & Linux : At the command prompt enter :
	    ./ssoupgrade 
	
	  Windows : At the command prompt enter :
	    ssoupgrade.bat

    - "ssoupgrade" will require the following inputs 
                o OpenSSO 8.0 Upgrade Base Directory
	o OpenSSO 8.0 Configuration Directory
	o OpenSSO 8.0 Staging Dir 
	o Directory Server full qualified host name
	o Directory Server port
	o Top-level Administrator DN (amAdmin DN)
	o Top-level Adminisrator Password (amAdmin password)

          or is an FM instance.).
	
xi. Restart the web container . 

xii.Login to OpenSSO 8.0 <protocol>://<host>:<port>/<deployURI>/UI/Login

xiii. Post Installation Step (Optional) :
	Windows : The uninstall of OpenSSO Packages has to
        be done manually . Follow the JES 5 Windows document 
        on uninstallation of OpenSSO :
            http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/819-5699

	Federation Manager : The FM 7.0 staging directory can be manually
        removed if desired.
