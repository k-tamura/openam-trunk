OpenSSO - Secure Attribute Exchange : Client API

This opensso.zip file contains Java and .Net interfaces to enable :
(i) an application (IDP-App) to generate SAE data to be sent across to a local 
    OpenSSO in IDP role (OpenSSO-IDP) acting as gateway
    to a SAMLv2 based COT.
(ii) an application (SP_App) to consume SAE data sent to it by a local OpenSSO
     in SP role (OpenSSO-SP)

The SAE protocol used to tranferring SAE data between the entities identified 
above is based on simple HTTP-GET and HTTP-redirect.


Java API  is provided in fmsae.jar
.Net API is provided in fmsae.dll.

Two ways of securing SAE data are provided : Symmetric crypto and Asymmetric
digital signing and data encryption. Symmetric method needs a shared secret between the application
and OpenSSO, while Asymmetric method uses X509 certificates.

Please refer to OpenSSO 8.0 product documentation, Javadocs and the
SAE sample 
Rest of this file proves a brief introduction.


IDP-App --- sae ---> OpenSSO-IDP ---| --->OpenSSO-SP --- sae ---> SP-App

Typical use on IDP-App end : also termed as the Asserting party.

0)  One time : 
 
   Register ApplicationName, SAE security type (Asymmetric or Symmetric),
   data encryption enabled or not, encryption algorithm, encryption key,
   and the corresponding shared secret/Public key alias with OpenSSO-IDP.
   Store shared secret in a safe place  preferably encrypted.
   The private key must be stored in a protected keystore and not revealed
   to OpenSSO. If data encryption is enabled and asymmetric crypto is used,
   import OpenSSO-IDP's public key to IDP-App's local keystore. 
   When asymmetric crypto is used, import IDP-App's public key to OpenSSO-IDP's
   keystore.

1) Initialize SecureAttrs class:
   if Asymmetric method is used:
   Java : SecureAttrs class needs enough information to open a
     java.security.KeyStore instance that contains the keys needed to 
     secure attributes to be sent to OpenSSO-IDP.
     Please refer to Javadocs for details on parameters.

   .Net : SecureAttrs class needs access to an appropriate 
        System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm instance.
        The type SecureAttrs.SAE_CRYPTO_ASYMMETRIC must be specified as
        part of init - else the default is SecureAttrs.SAE_CRYPTO_SYMMETRIC.

    If data encryption is used:
     SecureAttrs.SAE_CONFIG_DATA_ENCRYPTION_ALG and
     SecureAttrs.SAE_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STRENGTH need to be passed
     in to initialize SecureAttrs class.
2) Authenticate the user.

3) Construct a Map  (Java) or Hashtable (.Net) representing user attributes to 
   be asserted.  the following attribute names are predefined :
        
    sun.userid : string representing authenticated user.
    sun.spappurl : SP app to be invoked.
    sun.idpappurl : Application name
    sun.cmd : used to convey "logout" message. 
    Any number of custom attributes may be added.

    Embedded '|' and '=' characters must be escaped.

4) Retrieve shared secret if Symmetric method is used.
   Asymmetric method need the private key alias.
   If data encryption is used, same shared secret is used if Symmetric method
   is used. OpenSSO-IDP's public key alias is used to do data encryption
   if Asymmetric method is used.
   

5) Execute SecureAttrs.getInstance(<type>).getEncodedString() (Java) or
   SecureAttrs.getEncodedString(<type>) (.Net)
   passing the user attributes, shared secret or private key alias,
   and encryption secret(shared secret or public key alias).
   <type> is 
      SecureAttrs.SAE_CRYPTO_SYMMETRIC or SecureAttrs.SAE_CRYPTO_ASYMMETRIC
   When encryption secret is null, no data encryption is done.

6) The app may choose to send the SAE data to a local OpenSSO instance immediately 
   or may choose to construct a link that the user can click later.

   Example URL : <OpenSSO instance base url>/saml2/jsp/SA_IDP.jsp?sun.data=<SAE data>


SP-App typical usage : also called the Relying Party.

0)  One time : Register ApplicationName, SAE Security type (SYM or ASYM)
     and corresponding Shared secret. If data encryption is used, register
     encrytion algorithm and encryption key strength.
     Store shared secret in a safe place  preferably encrypted.
     If ASYM is used, retrieve OpenSSO public key and store it in a local keystore.
     If ASYM is used, and data encryption is used, retrieve SP-App's public
     key and store it in OpenSSO-SP's keystore.
     

1) Initialize SecureAttrs class:
   If Asymmetric method is used:

   Java : SecureAttrs class needs enough information to open a
     java.security.KeyStore instance that contains the keys needed to 
     verify attributes from local OpenSSO-SP.
     Please refer to Javadocs for details on parameters.

   .Net : SecureAttrs class needs access to an appropriate 
        System.Security.Cryptography.AsymmetricAlgorithm instance.

   If data encryption is used:
     SecureAttrs.SAE_CONFIG_DATA_ENCRYPTION_ALG and
     SecureAttrs.SAE_CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STRENGTH need to be passed
     in to initialize SecureAttrs class.


2) Be prepared to receive a HTTP-GET with sun.data query parameter.
    sun.data parameter contains Base64 encoded SAE data.

3) Retrieve shared secret is symmetric method is used.
   For asymmetric method be prepared to retrieve the key alias of OpenSSO-SP's public key.

   If data encryption is enabled and asymmetric method is used, be prepared to
   retrieve SP-App's private key alias.

4) Execute SecureAttrs.getInstance(instanceName).verifyEncodedString(type,secret, encSecret) [ Java] or
   SecureAttrs.verifyEncodedString() [.Net] to verify SAE data.

5) If SAE data verifies okay, returned Map contains user data that can be used 
    to establish a local user session.
    user.   

Single Logout (SLO) : IDP-App initiated global logout 

0) SP and IDP app registration as in previous usecases.
   SP-App additionally configures "saeSPLogoutURL" on local OpenSSO.
1) IDP-App initiates SLO by securely sending the "sun.cmd=logout" to local
   OpenSSO-IDP instance.
2) OpenSSO-IDP executes SAMLv2 SLO protocol to OpenSSO-SP.
3) OpenSSO-SP  picks up "saeSPLogoutURL" config and redirects to it.
4) saeSPLogoutURL logic can verify sun.data parameter sent to it;
   it contains two SAE params : sun.cmd=logout and sun.returnurl.
   After executing local processing (eg invalidating local app session/cleanup
   etc) the application MUST redirect back to the url specified in
   sun.returnurl. Otherwise the global logout across the SAMLv2 COT
   will terminate.
   Another point to be careful about is to ensure that "saeSPLogoutURL"
   should be up and running all the time  - else the SLO will terminate
   with an error.
