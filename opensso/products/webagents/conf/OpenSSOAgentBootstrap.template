#   authenticate itself before requesting any services. 
#   - organization.name:  Specifies the organization or realm name to be used

#       The default value "/" identifies the root organization or realm.
#   - username: Agent profile name

#
# AGENT DEBUG LOG LEVEL
#   Set the logging level for the specified logging categories.
#   The format of the values is
#
#	<ModuleName>[:<Level>][,<ModuleName>[:<Level>]]*
#
#   The currently used module names are: AuthService, NamingService,
#   PolicyService, SessionService, PolicyEngine, ServiceEngine,
#   Notification, PolicyAgent, RemoteLog and all.
#
#   The all module can be used to set the logging level for all currently
#   none logging modules.  This will also establish the default level for
#   all subsequently created modules.
#
#   The meaning of the 'Level' value is described below:
#
#	0	Disable logging from specified module*
#	1	Log error messages
#	2	Log warning and error messages
#	3	Log info, warning, and error messages
#	4	Log debug, info, warning, and error messages
#	5	Like level 4, but with even more debugging messages
#       128	log url access to log file on AM server. 
#       256	log url access to log file on local machine. 
#
#   If level is omitted, then the logging module will be created with
#   the default logging level, which is the logging level associated with
#   the 'all' module.
#
#   For level of 128 and 256, you must also specify audit.access.type property.
#
#   Even if the level is set to zero, some messages may be produced for
#   a module if they are logged with the special level value of 'always'.

#         Microsoft Windows users need to enter private key alias name here as imported by Windows Certificate Manager.
#   - com.forgerock.agents.config.cert.key.password: encrypted private key password (not used on Microsoft Windows platform);
#         use crypt_util to encrypt password with encryption key stored in com.sun.identity.agents.config.key property.
#   - com.forgerock.agents.config.cert.file: PEM encoded client certificate (not used on Microsoft Windows platform)
#   - com.forgerock.agents.config.cert.ca.file: a list of PEM encoded CA certificates (not used on Microsoft Windows platform)
#   - com.forgerock.agents.config.ciphers: cipher list according to http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html (not used on Microsoft Windows platform)

# Connection timeout related properties
#
#   - receive.timeout: Time in milliseconds the agent will wait to receive the
#       response from OpenAM server. After the timeout, the connection
#       will be drop. A value of 0 means that the agent will wait until 
#       receiving the response.
#       WARNING: Invalid value for this property can result in 
#       the resources becoming inaccessible.
#   - connect.timeout: In milliseconds indicates how long the socket connection 
#       needs to be kept open.  The default value is 0 which implies no timeout.
#   - tcp.nodelay.enable: Indicate if the socket option TCP_NODELAY should be enabled.
#       Possible values are true or false. Default is false.

#   to authenticate (referred as Agent Authenticator), following changes

#   1. com.sun.identity.agents.config.profilename should have the value of the
#      profile to be read
#   2. com.sun.identity.agents.config.username should have the value of the
#      Agent Authenticator
#   3. com.sun.identity.agents.config.password should have the password of
#      Agent Authenticator (this can be generated by executing the below 
#      command. "passwordFile" should have the password of Agent Authenticator.

#                           connect.timeout and receive.timeout values (total, in msec) must not exceed ping.interval value.
# - ping.miss.count:    when validation request is continuously failing and reached the number of ping.miss.count,
#                           policy agent will fail-over to the next URL value.
# - ping.ok.count:      when validation request is continuously succeeding and reached the number of ping.ok.count,
#                           policy agent will fail-back to the default URL value.
# - default.url.set:    comma-separated URL value indexes; must correspond to actual entries in naming.url values;
#                           For example: for two space separated entries in naming.url property, set
#                           default.url.set = 0,1 to specify fail-over order and default (first index) entry;
