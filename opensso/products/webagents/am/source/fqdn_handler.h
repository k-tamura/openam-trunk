/*
 * Class: FqdnHandler
 *
 * This class provides utility functions used by web-agents to
 * ensure that malformed URLs can be corrected by the agent in
 * order to avoid related cookie-masking, infinite-auth-redirection
 * and other such problems.
 *
 * The FqdnHandler can provide conclusive information indicating if
 * the correct FQDN has been used in the resource URL or not. In the
 * case when the correct FQDN has not been used in the resource URL,
 * the FqdnHandler can provide the alternate resource URL that the
 * agent can redirect the user to in order to ensure that the
 * subsequent request from the user is not malformed.
 *
 * This class relies on the following configuration keys read from
 * the agent configuration property file:
 *
 * 1) com.sun.am.policy.am.fqdnMap:
 *    This key contains a map that provides a simple mapping between
 *    various potentially malformed FQDNs with the actual correct
 *    FQDNs that must be used. For example:
 *
 *       foo -> foo.somecompany.com
 *       foo.somecompany -> foo.somecompany.com
 *
 *    The exact format for specifying this property is detailed out
 *    in the property file comments.
 *
 * 2) com.sun.am.policy.am.fqdnDefault:
 *    This key contains a value of the default FQDN to be used in
 *    the particular case where the resource URL's FQDN is malformed
 *    and not correctable based on the values specified in the
 *    com.sun.am.policy.am.fqdnMap property.
 *
 * To evaluate if a given resource URL is malformed, the FqdnHandler
 * first compares it with the valid FQDN entries in the map (such as
 * foo.somecompay.com) and also the value specified for the fqdnDefault
 * property. If there is a match, no further action is taken.
 * However, if there is no match, the incoming resource URL's FQDN
 * is compared with the invalid FQDN entires in the map (such as
 * foo, or foo.somecompany). If a match is found, the corresponding valid
 * FQDN from the map is used. If no match is found, then the fqdnDefault
 * property value is used.
 *
 * Special Case:
 * - In case this class determines that the user supplied URL does not
 *   contain a valid FQDN and at the same time no valid value can be
 *   determined, the redirect URL will then be that of access denied page
 *   or 403 status code.
 *
